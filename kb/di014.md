Code action `DI014` (Improvement) **Replace IFERROR with DIVIDE**

## Description

Use the [`DIVIDE`](https://dax.guide/DIVIDE) function instead of [`IFERROR`](https://dax.guide/IFERROR) to provide an alternate result when a division has a zero demoninator.

### Example 1

Change:
```dax
IFERROR([Total Sales] / [Total Cost], BLANK())
```
To:
```dax
DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Cost])
```

### Example 2

Change:
```dax
IFERROR(([Total Sales] - [Total Cost]) / [Total Cost], 1)
```
To:
```dax
DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Total Cost], [Total Cost], 1)
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

A common anti-pattern in DAX is to check for division-by-zero errors by using the `IFERROR` function. This pattern should be avoided, as evaluation errors add overhead to the query execution. Instead, the `DIVIDE` function should be used, as it checks that the denominator is not zero before the division is carried out. Moreover, using floating point arithmetics, the `DIVIDE` function is more robust and handles edge cases better than the `IFERROR` function. By using the `DIVIDE` function, the code becomes more concise and easier to understand.
