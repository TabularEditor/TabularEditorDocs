Code action `RW001` (Rewrites) **Rewrite TOTALxTD using CALCULATE**

## Description

Functions such as [`TOTALMTD`](https://dax.guide/TOTALMTD), [`TOTALQTD`](https://dax.guide/TOTALQTD) and [`TOTALYTD`](https://dax.guide/TOTALYTD) can be rewritten using the [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/CALCULATE) function.

### Example

Change:
```dax
 TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
```

To:
```dax
CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESYTD('Date'[Date]))
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

This rewrite is useful in case you want to add additional filters or modify the calculation context.

> [!NOTE]
> This code action is in the **Rewrites** category, which means that it does not represent a general recommendation or best practice. Instead, the code action provides a quick way to rewrite the code in a different way, for example as part of a larger refactoring. After applying the code action and until further edits are made, you may see an **Improvement** or **Readability** code action that suggests to modify the code back to its original state.
