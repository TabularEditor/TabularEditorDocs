Code action `DR005` (Readability) **Prefix temporary column**

## Description

It is recommended to use a consistent prefix for temporary columns, to more easily distinguish them from base columns or measures. The default prefix is `@` but you can configure which prefix to use, to match your preferred style, under **Tools > Preferences > DAX Editor > Code Actions**.

### Example

Change:
```dax
ADDCOLUMNS(
    'Sales',
    "Sales With Tax", 'Sales'[Sales Amount] * 1.25
)
```
To:
```dax
ADDCOLUMNS(
    'Sales',
    "@Sales With Tax", 'Sales'[Sales Amount] * 1.25
)
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

This code action is designed to improve the readability of your DAX code. By using a consistent naming convention for your temporary columns, it is easier to understand the purpose of each column, and to distinguish between base columns, measures, and extension columns.

## Remarks

This code action has an **(All occurrences)** variant, which will appear when multiple sections of code can be improved. This variant will apply the code action to all relevant sections of the document at once.
