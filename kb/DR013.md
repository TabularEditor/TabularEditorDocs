Code action `DR013` (Readability) **Simplify negated logic**

## Description

When a logical expression is negated, it is often more readable to rewrite the expression using the inverted operator.

### Example 1

Change:
```dax
NOT([Sales Amount] = [Budget Amount])
```

To:
```dax
[Sales Amount] <> [Budget Amount]
```

### Example 2

Change:
```dax
NOT([Cost Amount] < [Sales Amount])
```

To:
```dax
[Cost Amount] >= [Sales Amount]
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

Negated logic can be harder to read and understand than non-negated logic. By removing the negation (the [`NOT`](https://dax.guide/NOT) operator) and inverting the comparison operator, the code becomes more concise and easier to read.
