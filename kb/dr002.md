Code action `DR002` (Readability) **Use aggregator instead of iterator**

## Description

Use an aggregator function instead of an iterator function when possible, to simplify the code.

### Example

Change:
```dax
SUMX(Sales, Sales[Line Amount])
```
To:
```dax
SUM(Sales[Line Amount])
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

A scalar predicate is a simpler and more concise way (e.g. "syntax sugar") to express a column filter, compared to using the `FILTER` function explicitly. By using a scalar predicate, the code becomes easier to read and understand, as it removes unnecessary complexity and makes the intent of the filter expression more clear.
