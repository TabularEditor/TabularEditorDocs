**Thank you for choosing Tabular Editor 3!**

To help you get the most out of the tool, we have collected all of our onboarding material in this onboarding guide, that we hope you will enjoy. We recommend all new users of Tabular Editor 3 to read through this guide, skipping any topics that they are already familiar with.

> [!NOTE] 
> Some articles in this guide reference Tabular Editor 2, specifically the Command-Line Interface (CLI), for purposes of automated deployment and testing. A standalone CLI application to accompany Tabular Editor 3 is planned for release at a later time.

As this training material is focused on the Tabular Editor product, we assume that you already have a basic understanding of tabular data modeling (using either Power BI Desktop, Visual Studio or Tabular Editor 2.x). If you are new to tabular data modeling, we highly recommend looking into some of the training material and courses offered by third parties such as [sqlbi.com](https://sqlbi.com).
