# Data Refresh View
The Data Refresh view allows you to investigate in detail how your data is being refreshed on the server.
A new active refresh will appear when a new refresh is triggered through the TOM Explorer. 


<figure style="padding-top: 15px;">
  <img class="noscale" src="~/content/assets/images/data-refresh-view.png" alt="Data Refresh View" style="width: 550px;"/>
  <figcaption style="font-size: 12px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 75px; padding-right: 75px; color:#00766e"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Data Refresh View in Tabular Editor. New refresh can be started by right-clicking a table and selecting refresh </figcaption>
</figure>

A new refresh will run in the background so that you can continue to build your dataset, and Tabular Editor will let you know if the refresh fails with a pop up. 

> [!NOTE]
> All the messages and durations shown in the Data Refresh window are estimates only. Tabular Editor listens to [trace events from SSAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/trace-events/analysis-services-trace-events?view=asallproducts-allversions) during processing. SSAS is not guaranteed to send all trace messages to the client (for example it may throttle the trace event notifications during times of peak CPU/memory consumption). 

> [!TIP]
> If you need accurate and reliable information about refresh progress and durations, you should connect [SQL Server Profiler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sql-server-profiler/sql-server-profiler?view=sql-server-ver16) to your SSAS instance, and collect the information manually during processing.
