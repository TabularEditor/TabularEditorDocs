- Fixed an issue with the `ExportProperties` / `ImportProperties` methods not working for object collections, see [#245](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/245).
- Fixed an issue that prevented pasting calculation items, see [#237](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/237)
