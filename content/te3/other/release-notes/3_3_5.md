## Important!

**NOTE**: Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Improvements in 3.3.5

- New splash screen and icon, matching our new website brand.
- Updated TOM to [19.48.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64).
- Tabular Editor 3 now has a set of [configurable policies](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/common/policies.html), which let IT organisations govern certain Tabular Editor 3 features.
- Column widths can now be locked on the Messages, Macros and BPA views.
- Improved the Macros view with a right-click menu and toolbar buttons to open/edit macros.
- Added semantic analyzer and autocomplete support for the [`EVALUATEANDLOG`](https://dax.guide/evaluateandlog) and [`SAMPLEAXISWITHLOCALMINMAX`](https://dax.guide/sampleaxiswithlocalminmax) DAX functions.
- The "Revert" File menu option is now also available when a model was loaded from disk.
- DAX debugger now supports more types of DAX queries, specifically it is now possible to debug cell values when the query uses [`ADDCOLUMNS`](https://dax.guide/addcolumns), [`CALCULATETABLE`](https://dax.guide/calculatetable), [`SAMPLE`](https://dax.guide/sample), [`SAMPLEAXISWITHLOCALMINMAX`](https://dax.guide/sampleaxiswithlocalminmax), [`SUBSTITUTEWITHINDEX`](https://dax.guide/substitutewithindex) and [`SUMMARIZE`](https://dax.guide/summarize). This should ensure that most types of queries generated by PBI Desktop can be used with the TE3 debugger. Note that only cell values that originate from explicit measures can be debugged.
- Added a "Step into selection" option in the DAX debugger to make navigation easier. Use the shortcut key (Ctrl+B) or right-click anywhere in the code and choose "Step into selection" to navigate.
- Better visualisation of objects with errors/warnings in the TOM Explorer. Better icons in the Data Refresh tab.

## Bugfixes in 3.3.5

- More reliable detection of Azure AS Developer tier (D1), which would sometimes prevent Business Edition customers from accessing the AAS instance.
- Allow role name changes in PBI Desktop restricted mode, see [#624](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/624).
- Fix SortByColumn not settable, see [#625](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/625).
- Fixed an issue that would prevent Tabular Editor to connect to ODBC data sources, when connection string properties were specified as "Extended Properties" in the connection string.
- Use TOP row limit clause for Snowflake ODBC by default.
- Fix issue with wait spinner overlapping "SelectItem" dialog when executed as script/macro. See [#622](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/622).
- Fixed an issue with how the debugger handles (blank) and binary values in filters.
- Automatic fallback to `Protocol Format=xml` if the connection fails due to invalid Binary XML. See [#637](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/637).
- Fix "Batch rename" not available in Power BI Desktop models.
- Add M parser support for special characters, see [#638](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/638).
- Treat 'version' as a DAX reserved word (i.e. always quote and show an error if used unquoted or as a variable name).
