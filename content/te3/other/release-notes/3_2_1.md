## Improvements in 3.2.1

- The debugger has been improved in various ways. For example, it is now easier to manage Watch expressions through a right-click context menu. You can also quickly add a measure, a variable reference, or a subexpression to the Watch expression view by right-clicking in the editor. See [this article](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/te3/features/dax-debugger.html) for more information.
- A new serialization option is available, which ensures that the JSON arrays for roles/perspectives are sorted by name when saved to disk, see [#341](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/341). Find the new option under **Tools > Preferences > File Formats > Sort arrays by name** (or to change the setting for an existing model go to **Model > Serialization options...**).

- Various offline DAX formatter improvements, to make the offline formatter more consistent with https://daxformatter.com.
- Fix issue with comment frames being added to the previous expression in a DAX script, see [#331](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/331).
- Fix application crash at launch, issue [#328](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/328).

- Replace existing table should no longer cause a crash, see issue [#368](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/368).
- Fix BPA not running until BPA view is first shown, see issue [#367](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/367).
- Use a single partition for AS change detection when connected to AS standard tier (which doesn't allow tables with multiple partitions). See [#336](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/discussions/336).
- Inherit perspective membership for columns added through schema compare. See issue [#342](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/discussions/342).
