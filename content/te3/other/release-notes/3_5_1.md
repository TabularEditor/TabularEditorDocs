### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Bugfixes and improvements in 3.5.1

- Updated TOM to [19.60.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64/).
- Fixed an issue with the Edit Relationship dialog showing an incompatible data type warning, even if the data types on both columns are identical, see [#855](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/855). Moreover, when connected to an instance of Analysis Services, the dialog now displays RI violation and duplicate value warnings.
- Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause the application to freeze when opening a file or folder structure from disk.
- Fixed an issue that prevented editing RLS expressions when a role contained a "." in its name.
- When an object is shown in multiple display folders, the TOM Explorer didn't correctly refresh its properties in all places. This has been fixed.
- "Model" is now treated as a reserved word in the Semantic Analyzer, see [#852](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/852).
- The .pbitool file (used for External Tool integration with PBI Desktop) now uses the updated TE3 icon.
- The Create Workspace Database dialog now validates the database name, preventing special characters that are not supported by Analysis Services.
- Fixed an issue with auto-indent overwriting characters in the DAX editor. See [#857](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/857).
- You can now create add tables/calculation groups directly to a table group through the table group's right-click context menu.
- Fixed an regression in 3.5.0, where importing columns or performing a schema update on a table from an MS SQL-flavored data source, would result in the wrong data type being assigned to the column.
- Fixed an issue where closing a bracket or parenthesis would sometimes "snap" the cursor to the wrong position in the DAX editor.
