## Improvements in 3.1.7

- When a DAX query causes Analysis Services to return an error message, that message is now displayed in place of the previous result grid.
- Grids can now be zoomed (ctrl+mouse wheel)!
- Various auto-complete improvements and auto-indent improvements.
- A new right-click menu makes it easy to add table permissions to roles (previously, you would have to add a table permission by assigning an RLS expression or specify an OLS setting). See issue [#257](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/257). You can add multiple table permissions across multiple roles at once.
- The "Select database" dialog now remembers sort order of columns. See [#321](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/321).

## Bugfixes in 3.1.7

- Fix issue with SaveModelMetadataBackup not working for database IDs (when IDs and Names are different).
- Fix crash when resetting auto format preferences
- Fix missing export of TOM in VPAX. Fix message dialog when VPAX contains TOM.
- Improved DAX (offline) formatting, see issue [#306](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/306).
- Fixed issue with `FormatDax(...)` and `CallDaxFormatter()` helper functions when using the default (offline) formatter, see [#307](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/307).
- Fixed an issue with auto-complete sometimes getting "stuck".
- Fewer windows/dialogs should have display scaling issues when the Windows display resolution or scaling is changed. See [#308](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/308) and [#81](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/81).
- Auto-formatter should no longer repeat multi-line comment blocks. See [#319](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/319].
- Fixed an issue with the background semantic analysis reporting invalid DAX errors, see [#311](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/311).
- Opening the BPA manager through the menu bar should no longer cause a crash, see [#312](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/312).
- Saving a model in workspace mode, that was loaded from a Database.json file, should no longer cause a "Save failed!" error, see issue [#322](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/322).
- Comments are now correctly retained when applying a DAX script, see issue [#323](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/323).
