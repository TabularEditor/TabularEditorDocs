> [!NOTE]
> We are now providing native [ARM64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) builds in addition to regular 64-bit (x64) builds. 32-bit (x86) builds have been discontinued.

## New in 3.23.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

- The **Table Import Wizard** now supports **Fabric SQL Databases** and **Fabric Mirrored Databases** as data sources, both for Import and Direct Lake mode models, in line with the [announcement in the Power BI Desktop July 2025 update](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-july-2025-feature-summary/#post-30545-_Toc203388697).
- Native [ARM64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) support.
- Preparations for upcoming Power BI features (which we can't disclose just yet).

## Improvements in 3.23.0

- Main window now remembers its position & size. Can be disabled in Preferences > Tabular Editor > User Interface > Layout.
- Messages view now copies the selected cell rather than the whole row by default, Ctrl+Shift+C can be used to copy the whole row as before. There is a new right click context menu with these (Copy Cell, Copy Row) options as well.
- Updated 3rd party dependencies including AMO/TOM to [v. 19.103.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices/).
- A new word wrap option is now exposed in toolbar, menu (Edit > Word Wrap) and preferences window (Text Editors > General). Line wrap indicators can also be enabled in the preferences.
- The C# script editor's auto complete now provides more flexible search (i.e. search for partial matches and search by capital letters).
- You can now use the "Apply" or "Apply selection" action on DAX queries containing [`DEFINE COLUMN`](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/introducing-define-column-in-dax-queries/) or [`DEFINE TABLE`](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/introducing-define-table-in-dax-queries/) statements, in addition to `DEFINE MEASURE` statements. This will create the corresponding calculated columns or calculated tables in the model, or update their DAX expressions if they already exist.
- Peek definition window now lets user scroll the main DAX editor instead of swallowing mouse scroll inputs while the mouse is on it.
- Peek definition window height is now adjusted more tightly.
- Semantic Analyzer no longer shows "Multiple column cannot be converted to a scalar value" errors, when there are other, more indicative error messages.

## Bugfixes in 3.23.0

- Fixed a bug where you would have to enable **Allow unsupported modelling operations** in order to make any changes to a model in Power BI Desktop, even though modelling operations were supported.
- Fixed a bug where main window exceeds screen dimensions depending on resolution and DPI scaling.
- Fixed toolbar customization settings such as "Large icons", "Show ScreenTips on toolbars" etc. not persisting after restarting TE3.
- Fixed a visual glitch where TOM Explorer's Perspective and Language drop-down controls have duplicate buttons.
- Fixed a bunch of issues with "Peek definiton" feature:
  - Peek definition is closed on undo/redo operations
  - Peek definition is invisible when used on the last line of DAX editor
  - Peek definition turns invisible when the line ending of the peeked reference is deleted
  - Peek definition is also closed when trying to instead close auto-complete popup with ESC
  - Peek definition is also closed when trying to instead clear rectangular-selection with ESC
  - When a new line is added to the left of peeked reference, peek definition turns invisible and empty padding space incorrectly appears above the peeked reference
  - Fix empty padding space appearing under the wrong line if the caret is on a different line than the peeked reference when the peek definition is triggered
- Calltips in the C# code editor are now sized correctly, ensuring that all of the calltip text is visible.
- Fixed a bug where Fabric Warehouses were not correctly listed in the Fabric connection dialog (instead they were shown as type "Unknown").
- DAX autocomplete should no longer suggest `DAY` for the &lt;Interval&gt; parameter of the [`PARALLELPERIOD`](https://dax.guide/parallelperiod) function, as this is not a valid value for that parameter.
- Calltips will now update correctly when swapping between different syntax alternatives using the up/down arrows.
- Fixed a bug where code actions did not update correctly when switching between objects.
- Fix line numbers in code editors getting cut off when zoomed in.
