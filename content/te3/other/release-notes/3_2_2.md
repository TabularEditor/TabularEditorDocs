## Improvements in 3.2.2

- Added support for Query Groups (aka. Power Query "folders") on partitions and named expressions
- Prompt for first partition type. See [#406](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/406)
- Aligned display of relationship names to be similar to how VertiPaq Analyzer in DAX Studio displays the names.
- Allow debug commas in the Expression Editor, see [#407](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/407)
- Allow doubleclicking on any expression object in the TOM Explorer (such as partitions) to bring the quick editor into view
- Changed "Mixed" label to "Hybrid" on tables that contain multiple partitions types
- Pivot Grid:
  - Pivot Grid now displays a grand total when slicing on a field that only has a single value (when field is used in the rows/columns area)
  - Fields added to the Pivot Grid through the TOM Explorer context menu are now added "right-most".- Focus pivot grid cell on right-click
- DAX debugger improvements:
  - Can now view and enable/disable individual filters from the outer filter context
  - Added tooltips for watch/locals value types.
  - Better determination and ordering of local items from current call (includes subexpressions within the same evaluation context, etc.)
  - No longer shows a context transition on the evaluation context stack, when debugging a measure reference (step into the measure reference to see the context transition)
  - No longer use TREATAS against SSAS 2016
  - Improved F10 (step over) within measures
  - Improved auto-complete for Watch expression editor (is now able to suggest row context columns, variables, etc.)
- Updated TOM to [19.34.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64/)

## Bugfixes in 3.2.2

- Added more TOM properties, i.e.: Refresh Policy Mode (used to set up Hybrid tables refresh policy)
- Fix activation wizard hang, see [#419](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/419) 
- Make sure custom toolbars can still be dragged/docked and customized after first layout restore. See issue [#413](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/413) 
- Fix issue with properties panel not showing when invoking through context menu, see [#375](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/375) 
- Prevent crash when navigating to Data Refresh from status bar, see issue [#370](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/370) 
- Fixed an issue where application crashes when closing while a refresh is running in the background.
- Prevent expression editor from appearing when clicking in the Diagram. See issue [#43](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/43). Also improves behavior of selecting/dragging columns in the diagram view.
- Added missing fields to VeritPaq Analyzer, see [#372](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/372)
- Improved Pivot Grid behavior of calculation group columns. See [#412](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/412)
- Ensure Dependency View is updated every time a semantic analysis completes (such as when a model is modified through Power BI), see [#401](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/401)    
- Do not suggest calc group functions in auto-complete, unless writing a calc item expression, see issue [#387](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/387) 
- Fixed an issue where after uncommenting a selection, "undo" no longer behaves correctly. See [#301](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/301)    
- Added shortcuts for comment (Ctrl+Shift+K)/uncomment (Ctrl+Shift+U). See [#371](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/371)    
- Added shortcuts (Alt+Up/Down arrow) for moving selected lines up/down in text editors. See [#371](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/371)    
- Fix stackoverflow exception when dragging windows around in certain ways. See [#354](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/354)    
- Fix bug with macro recorder not stopping when a C# script view is closed, causing subsequent crash when a model object or property is changed.
- Macro recorder now also produces code for calc item expression changes as well as hierarchy level and calc item ordinal changes. See [#230](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/230)
- Debugger: Fix DAX generation for variables in outer filter context, see issue [#418](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/418)
- Check for and delete TablePermissions with invalid table references upon model load (previously, TE would not allow loading a model with such invalid references)
- Clear filter when a field is removed/hidden from a Pivot Grid, see issue [#427](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/427)
