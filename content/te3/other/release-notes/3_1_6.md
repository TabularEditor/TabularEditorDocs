## Improvements in 3.1.6

- DAX editor improvements:
  - **Offline DAX formatting now available**. The "Format DAX" buttons and shortcuts (F6) now use the built-in DAX formatter instead of www.daxformatter.com. The built-in formatter has a few more configuration options and also fixes column and measure references that do not follow best practices, and more. Since the built-in formatter does not perform a web request, it is also significantly faster. If you encounter an issue with the built-in formatter, you can disable it by enabling the **Use daxformatter.com instead of built-in formatter" under **Tools > Preferences > DAX Editor**.
  - You can now configure keywords/functions to be formatted with different casing, based on your preferences. Find the settings under **Tools > Preferences > DAX Editor > Auto Formatting**, see [#58](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/58). [More details](xref:personalizing-te3#dax-settings).
  - Added an option for "Debug comma" formatting for DAX queries (puts all commas in front of the line, for easy comment/uncomment of subexpressions), see [#96](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/96).
  - You can now select an entire object reference (measure, column, etc.) by double-clicking on it (previously, only the word under the cursor would get selected).
  - When a subexpression is selected and an opening brace (parenthesis or curly brace) is entered, the selection is wrapped with a matching closing brace, see [#48](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/48).
  - Code assist no longer interferes when writing comments.
- TE3 can now import and update table schemas from Snowflake (Power BI data models only).
- Updated TOM to 19.27.2.1
- C# script method `SelectObjects` is now available, which prompt the user to select one or more objects given a list of objects.
- New option, **Tools > Preferences > TOM Explorer > Show full branch**. When this is checked, filtering the TOM Explorer will also show all child objects, even when they do not match the filter string. See [#276](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/276).
- New option, **Tools > Preferences > TOM Explorer > Always show delete warnings**. When this is checked, all delete operations will display a confirmation dialog. When unchecked, only multi-select deletions and deletion of objects referenced by other objects will display the confirmation dialog (remember, every operation can be undone in Tabular Editor). See [#10](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/10).
- Added the "Apply Refresh Policy" menu option on tables, when applicable. See [Configure Incremental Refresh with Tabular Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icCGFG6KpIA) for more information, see also [#291](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/291).
- Added the DAX dependency view to the **View** menu, and added a checkbox that lets the dependency view track the current selection in the TOM Explorer, see[#10](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/10).

## Bugfixes in 3.1.6

- The Preferences, SelectItems and Save/Edit Macro dialogs can now be resized, see[#51](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/51).
- When an "Update table schema" operation is performed against a Power BI Desktop model that uses native queries for data import, we will bring the PBI Desktop instance to the front, as a dialog pops up in Desktop which needs to be accepted, before the "Update table schema" operation can complete, see issue [#55](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/55).
- Taskbar icon should no longer break when upgrading. See[#163](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/163).
- When updating table schemas, you will now be shown a connection dialog that allows you to change the auth mode. See[#262](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/262).
- The `MemberId` role member property is now removed automatically only when deploying a model to Azure AS or Power BI. See [#263](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/263).
- Fixed an issue with freezing UI when queuing multiple refresh operations, see [#281](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/281).
- AAD object picker should now produce a well-formed object name. See[#286](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/286).
- When executing a DAX script that creates a calculation group, the ordinals are now assigned correctly, see [#296](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/296).
- CTRL + arrows can now be used to expand/collapse all nodes in the TOM Explorer, similar to TE 2.x, see [#297](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/297).
- When executing a DAX script that creates a calculation group, the column name is now assigned correctly, see [#298](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/298).
- Fixed a bug where DAX script locales were not updated correctly when switching between US/Non-US mode.
- Fixed a crash that would occur when trying to connect to an AS server contains databases with no compatibility level (happens when connecting to an instance of AS tabular that shares its data dir with an instance of AS multidimensional).
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the "Update table schema" feature to report all columns as missing from the source.
- Fixed an issue with the Table Preview feature, that would cause grid columns to be configured incorrectly, when using impersonation.
- Fixed an issue with semantic change notification bar not disappearing when saving the model.
- Fixed an issue with property grid edits not being committed automatically when saving the model.
