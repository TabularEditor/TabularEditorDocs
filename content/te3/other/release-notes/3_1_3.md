## Bugfixes in 3.1.3

- Fixed a memory leak that occurs when the application is idle. This issue has existed since v. 3.1.1.

## Bugfixes in 3.1.2

- Fixed an issue with Update Table Schema not working for SQL DW / Synapse SQL Pool data sources, see [#231](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/231).
- Fixed an issue where ignored rules were still considered by the Best Practice Analyzer, see [#203](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/203).
- Fixed an issue where models could not be saved to disk (file or folder) due to a JSON serialization error, see [#232](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/232).
- Fixed an issue that caused a crash when inspecting the property values of a Structured Data Source.

## Improvements in 3.1.1

- Shared Expressions (Power Query / M expressions) can now be serialized as individual files. You can control the serialization under **Tools > Preferences > Save-to-folder** or for an existing model under **Model > Serialization options...** ([#218](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/218))
- New options for controlling how perspective memberships are applied to new objects under **Tools > Preferences > Modeling Operations** (see issue [#216](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/216)).
- `PrivacySetting` property can now be excluded from serialization, to prevent issues with Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Deployment. This is controlled under **Model > Serialization options...** (see issue [#210](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/210)).
- You can now define enums, structs and classes directly within a C# script, making it easier to structure and reuse C# code.
- VertiPaq Analyzer now has an option to collect statistics from data (**Tools > Preferences > VertiPaq Analyzer**), improving the quality of the statistics, for example when columns have IsAvailableInMDX = false. See issue [#190](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/290).
- When a new model is created, Tabular Editor 3 now prompts if the model should be saved as a file or folder, the first time it is saved. You can also set the default mode under **Tools > Preferences > General > Default save format for new models**. See issue [#50](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/50).
- Improved startup performance (some users have reported additional startup time gains by adding the `-multicorejit` switch to the TabularEditor3.exe shortcut).
- Restructured the "Model" menu to make options such as "New calculation group" readily available.
- Updated AMO/TOM client libraries to [19.26.1.7](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64/).
- Model Role Members can now be iterated individually in the Best Practice Analyzer
- "Workspace" within the "Window" menu has been renamed to "Layout" to avoid confusion with [Workspace Mode](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/te3/tutorials/workspace-mode.html).
- Added Ctrl+Shift+D as a shortcut for "Deploy"
- Support for new DAX functions ([`HASH`](https://dax.guide/hash), [`NAMEOF`](https://dax.guide/nameof), [`COLUMNSTATISTICS`](https://dax.guide/columnstatistics), [`BITAND`](https://dax.guide/bitand), [`BITLSHIFT`](https://dax.guide/bitlshift), [`BITOR`](https://dax.guide/bitor), [`BITRSHIFT`](https://dax.guide/bitrshift), [`BITXOR`](https://dax.guide/bitxor)) and support for optional column name parameter in [`SELECTCOLUMNS`](https://dax.guide/selectcolumns).

## Bugfixes in 3.1.1

- TOM Explorer should no longer freeze or crash when deleting objects (see issues [#223](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/223), [#209](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/209)).
- Fixed a color issue with dark themes in editors ([#207](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/207)) and icons ([#215](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/215))
- Tables are now sorted alphabetically in the "Create/Edit Relationship" dialog (see issue [#214](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/214)
- Fixed an issue with C# scripts that prevented saving them as macros (see issue [#208](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/208)).
- Fixed an issue with data source passwords/credentials not being properly applied to workspace database (see issue [#205](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/205)).
- "Select all columns" checkbox should no longer cause a crash (see issue [#204](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/204)).
- Tabular Editor now always looks in the installation directory when a script references external DLL's (using the `#r` precompiler directive), see issue [#192](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/192).
- Fixed a bug with linguistic schema that caused Q&A to stop working some cases
- Filtering on a date column in Data Preview should no longer cause a crash
- When selecting all perspectives in the TOM Explorer perspectives-dropdown, objects that do not included in any perspectives are no longer shown. Also fixed an issue with the dropdown box not updating perspective names.
- Allow using certain DAX keywords as variables (`WEEK`, `DAY`, `INTEGER`, etc.) without showing an error.
- Fix issue with serialization options not being stored the first time a model is saved.
- Fixed an issue with the DAX parser which would cause a crash upon loading a model (see [#229](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/229)).
