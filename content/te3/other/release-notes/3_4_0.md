## Important!

**NOTE**: Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New features in 3.4.0

- Updated TOM to [19.54.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64).
- Tabular Editor 3 now supports the [new DAX window functions](https://pbidax.wordpress.com/2022/12/15/introducing-dax-window-functions-part-1/) announced in the Power BI Desktop December 2022 update.
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts are here! Do you want to always use CTRL+S to save the model, regardless of context? Do you want to assign a hotkey to perform a model refresh? How about an editor shortcut to [select all occurrences of current selection](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/630)? Find this feature under **Tools > Preferences > Keyboard**. More info [here](xref:preferences#tabular-editor--keyboard).
- All code editors now allow multiple selections (i.e. hold down CTRL and drag using the mouse, to create a new selection), in addition to rectangular selections (holding down ALT while dragging or using SHIFT + arrow keys).

## Minor improvements in 3.4.0

- Tabular Editor 3 now displays the correct icon in the Power BI External Tools ribbon.
- Consolidated editing of Column-type properties in the property grid. You can now specify a column by typing its name in the property grid. When more than 7 columns are present, a "select column" dialog appears instead of a dropdown. This also fixes [#738](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/738).
- Removed square brackets from column names in Table Preview
- It is now possible to connect and select a different Power BI workspace in the Import Table Wizard.
- Pivot Grid field list is now a dockable window, see [#742](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/742).
- DAX calltips are now formatted correctly when the source descriptions contain HTML tags.
- All code editors now have much improved rectangular selections, when using the keyboard to perform selection. Moreover, copy/paste now works more intuitively with rectangular selections.
- Added option to lock menus and toolbar, to prevent accidentally dragging them around, in the Tools > Customize dialog (under the "Options" tab).
- Scintilla multiple selection add next/add each now respects search flags specified in the Find Dialog.
- Allow File.SaveModel shortcut to work regardless of context, see [#762](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/762).
- It is now possible to cancel a long-running save operation, such as when the database is locked by a refresh operation. See [#730](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/730).
- Create/edit relationship dialog can now be resized, see [#732](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/732).
- Allow arrow key expand/collapse on all tree lists (including BPA, dependency view and data refresh view), see [#775](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/775).
- We've listened to your feedback! "Show relationships from table" is now back in the Dependency View, see [#731](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/731).

## Bugfixes in 3.4.0

- The AAD connect dialog should now show up as a modal dialog in all cases.
- Create undo transaction when multiple objects are edited in batch
- An object property (such as SortByColumn) can now be cleared by right-clicking and choosing "Reset".
- Right-click shortcut for editing table expression properties (SourceExpression, PollingExpression, etc.) are now available, see [#721](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/721).
- Pivot Grid should no longer freeze when fields are dragged on top of it, see [#676](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/676).
- Fix issue [#723](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/723).
- Fixed an issue that prevented table schema updates and crashed the Import Table Wizard, when attempting to import from an existing Power BI Dataflow, specified in the .tmuo file.
- Fixed an issue with the DAX debugger generating invalid watch expression DAX queries, see [#770](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/770).
- Fixed an issue which would sometimes cause the debugger windows to crash (showing red crosses on a white background).
- Fixed an issue where the Import Table Wizard would sometimes show Dataflows with no names.
- "Revert" button should always be enabled now. Moreover, a confirmation prompt is only shown when changes have been made. See [#729](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/729).
- Showing the field list no longer clears the Pivot Gird, see [#741](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/741).
- Fixed an issue where columns in the TOM Explorer would sometims be "cut off" when the application is launched.
- TOM Explorer now only allows adding EntityPartitions on Power BI datasets
- Fix dependency view crash issue, see [#758](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/758)
- Fixed an issue where floating windows could spawn outside the visible screen area when the application is restarted, see [#652](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/652).
- Fix issue with recent server not being persisted.
- Fixed a few bugs related to how actions appear in the "Model" and/or "Context" menu. For example, "Script DAX" in the Model menu, only scripted objects within the current selection, where as it was intended to script all objects in the model.
- Fix horizontal scrollbar behavior of text editors.
- SQL Connection Dialog should now persist its changes to the connection string, see [#755](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/755).
- Selecting a database after filtering the list in the "Choose database" dialog, now ensures that the correct database is actually loaded. See [#761](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/761).
- Fix issue when scrolling through tables (see [#733](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/733), and row count not updating when applying filter criteria.
