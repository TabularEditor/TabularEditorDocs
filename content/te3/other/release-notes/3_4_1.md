### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New features in 3.4.1

- New [Perspective Editor](xref:perspective-editor) view.

## Minor improvements in 3.4.1

- DAX debugger now supports window functions ([`OFFSET`](https://dax.guide/offset), [`INDEX`](https://dax.guide/index) and [`WINDOW`](https://dax.guide/window)).
- DAX debugger now lets you debug a measure that is being referenced in a table constructor, such as `EVALUATE { [Internet Sales] }` or in the [`ROW`](https://dax.guide/row) function.
- The **Evaluation Context** view now shows the expression of table variables used as filters.
- Resetting the window layout through the **Window** menu, now no longer affects toolbar buttons (these can be modified or reset through the **Tools > Customize** dialog).

## Bugfixes in 3.4.1

- Fixed an issue with the search box above the keyboard command list in the preferences dialog.
- DAX editors now deal correctly with nested comments, see [#681](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/681).
- Attempting to debug query-scoped measures no longer causes a crash.
- Fixed an issue that caused relationship lines in the diagram view to become "stuck", see [#787](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/787).
- When tracking TOM Explorer selection in the dependency view, application should no longer crash when selecting a relationships, see [#782](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/782).
- Fixed the "DataSourceConverter cannot convert from TabularEditor.TOMWrapper.ProviderDataSource" error, when attempting to change or reset the DataSource property on a partition.
- Tabular Editor 3 should no longer replace blank characters at the end of file names with `%20`, when using "Save to folder".
- Expression Editor should no longer be empty until its header is clicked, see [#739](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/739).
- DAX debugger now correctly simulates the auto-exist behavior of [`SUMMARIZECOLUMNS`](https://dax.guide/summarizecolumns).
- Fixed an issue where the presence of `ALL()`, `ALLSELECTED()`, and other filter removal functions, did not cause outer filters to be striked out (indicating that the filters had been overwritten) in the **Evaluation Context** view.
- Fixed the missing context menu option to refresh a Calculated Table or Calculation Group.
- Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause a crash when attempting to perform a schema update.
- It is now no longer possible to debug a measure that has been removed from the model (which would otherwise cause a crash).
- Better exception handling when objects are pasted into the TOM Explorer.
- Fixed an issue that would cause a crash when an object is deleted while being shown in the **Search Results** view.
- Fixed an issue that would cause a crash in the **Table Preview**, when columns or tables were deleted.
- Semantic Analyzer no longer reports an error when the `<Relation>` parameter of a window function is left blank, or when it contains extension columns. See [#807](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/807).
- The "Reset" button in the Customize dialog should no longer remove all buttons from a toolbar.
- C# script editor should no longer insert an additional tab or newline character when performing an auto complete by pressing one of these keys.
