### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New in 3.9.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/07/21/tabular-editor-3-july-2023-release/) to get an overview of the most important updates in this release.

- Customers on one of the Azure for Government cloud, can now specify the base url that Tabular Editor 3 should use, when connecting to the Power BI REST API, such as when importing tables from a Power BI Dataflow. This setting is specified under **Tools > Preferences > Power BI > Power BI Service**.
- When selecting more than one cell in a DAX query result or a Pivot Grid, we now show a summary of the values selected in the application status bar (sum, minimum, maximum, average, etc.). Hold down Shift/Ctrl to select ranges the way you'd usually do. Shift+click on a column header will select all cells in that column. See [#475](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/475).

## Improvements in 3.9.0

- We've rearranged some of the pages and sections of the preferences dialog, making it easier to navigate.
- We're now using the latest version of TOM/AMO ([19.65.7.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64)) and [TMDL preview-3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Tabular.Tmdl.NetCore.retail.amd64/19.65.7.2-TmdlPreview).
- We've also updated AdomdClient to [19.65.7.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient.NetCore.retail.amd64/), which should improve the performance of our Pivot Grid component.
- VertiPaq Analyzer has been updated to version [1.2.18](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dax.Metadata).
- When a calculated table is left with a blank expression, we now show the error icon immediately in the TOM Explorer.
- It is now possible to add objects to Pivot Grids or Diagrams, even when those documents do not have focus (assuming no more than one such document is open). Moreover, you can now create a Pivot Grid by right-clicking on a measure, saving a few clicks, when you just need to test the value of a measure.
- We now show an error message, if attempting to assign an expression that produces a value of type 'Variant' to a calculated column (this is not allowed).
- We've added a separate option for saving zipped model.bim backups under **Tools > Preferences > Model Deployment**. You can now choose to have backups saved upon every deployment, upon every save (while connected to an instance of Analysis Services), or both. Note, this feature is not available for TE3 Desktop Edition. This also fixed issue [#796](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/796).
- We've added additional info columns to VertiPaq Analyzer, to align with those available in [DAX Studio](https://daxstudio.org).
  
> [!NOTE]
> TMDL is still in preview, and as such, this feature must also be considered a preview feature of Tabular Editor 3. Make sure to keep a Model.bim / Database.json backup of your model metadata to avoid losing work.

## Bugfixes in 3.9.0

- Fix false "Circular dependency" errors, encountered both in the DAX Editor, as well as in the TOM Explorer / Messages View. See issues [#920](https://tabulareditor.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/920) and [#931](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/931).
- Fixed an issue that prevented the Search and Replace dialog from searching in floating (undocked) document windows.
- Various stability improvements (should fix [#937](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/937), among other things).
- Fixed a crash that would occur when attempting to format DAX code containing window functions.
- Fixed a bug that caused Tabular Editor to use the System proxy when choosing Proxy Type "None" under **Tools > Preferences > Proxy settings**, and vice versa.
- Semantic Analyzer now works correctly with the [`DETAILROWS`](https://dax.guide/detailrows) function, see [#938](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/938).
- Fixed an issue where changing the name of a macro would not update the folder structure of macros, until the application was restarted.
- Fixed a bug that caused certain column and hierarchy properties to be read-only, preventing users from correctly setting up calculated tables, relationships, etc., while connected to Power BI Desktop. See [#929](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/929) and [#930](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/930).
- Fixed a crash in the DAX editor, when using the [`WINDOW`](https://dax.guide/window) function with certain parameters.
- Fixed an issue with the M parser not interpreting `[]` correctly, preventing the offline schema comparer from inferring metadata from an M expression such as `PowerPlatform.Dataflows([])`. See [#936](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/936).
- Fixed an issue where the PivotGrid would crash if a measure had a malformed format string assigned.
- Fixed an issue where the Semantic Analyzer would assign "Variant" as the data type of an expression resulting from the use of [`SWITCH`](https://dax.guide/switch) with one or more branches returning [`BLANK`](https://dax.guide/blank).
- Fixed a few bugs related to column filters on table previews. When getting the list of unique values of a column, we now read the first 5000 values (in ascending order). Previously, only 500 values were read, with no ordering specified, causing inconsistent behavior. See [#924](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/924).
