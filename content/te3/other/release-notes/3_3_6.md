## Important!

**NOTE**: Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Improvements in 3.3.6

- Updated TOM to [19.52.2.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64).
- Added support for measure Format String expressions (Compatibility Level 1601 or higher).
- Table `SourceExpression` and `PollingExpression` M queries can now be edited through the primary Expression Editor.
- Right-clicking on an expression property (such as `SourceExpression`, `PollingExpression`, `FormatStringExpression`, etc.) in the property grid now has a shortcut to edit the value in the primary Expression Editor.
- A Data Column's `SourceColumn` property value now appears in the "Expression" column of the TOM Explorer
- Added TOM Explorer and VertiPaq Analyzer column header tooltips.
- M parser improvements and support for additional M functions when performing offline Schema Updates, including support for CommandTimeout, and other connection options.
- Tabular Editor now displays a toast notification when a data refresh operation finishes in the background. This can be disabled under **Tools > Preferences > Features > Notifications**.
- Added support for new DAX functions ([OFFSET](https://dax.guide/offset), [TOJSON](https://dax.guide/tojson), [TOCSV](https://dax.guide/tocsv), and more).
- Macros are now compiled in a background thread, which improves application start-up time, and also fixes [#708](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/708).
- Updated to use the latest version of [VertiPaq Analyzer](https://github.com/sql-bi/VertiPaq-Analyzer).
- Added Compatibility Level 1600 as new default for SQL Server 2022 models.

## Bugfixes in 3.3.6

- DAX debugger now correctly preserves the original query expression when debugging, thus preserving the original shadow filter context and any auto-exist modifications to table filters. Among other things, this means that expressions containing `ALLSELECTED` can now be debugged properly, see [#669](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/669).
- Improved async connectivity during Table Import Wizard / Schema Update. Also improved error handling - for example when SQL connection fails due to a missing certificate.
- Fixed an issue with the Delete button not working in the Macros view.
- Fixed an issue with the M parser not supporting records when the field name contains a space, such as `[Order Date]`. This should allow the Schema Update feature to work in offline mode, when an M expression contains such a record reference.
- Fixed a bug where the .tmuo file was not updated when using workspace mode with a folder structure, causing credentials to not be saved between sessions.
- Fixed a bug that allows searching all expression properties, see [#663](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/663).
- Fixed an issue where the debugger script did not close when closing a model.
- Removed the possibility of adding partitions to calculated tables.
- Fixed an issue where the application would sometimes crash when using the Find/Replace dialog.
- Fixed incorrect tooltip for New DAX Script button, see [#678](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/678).
- Fixed an issue where floating docs being closed would not prompt for save, see [#673](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/673).
- Fixed an issue where the column filter on a Data Preview, would sometimes crash the application when toggling (All) or (Blank) values.
- Fixed an issue with Snowflake data type inference when using Schema Update or Table Import Wizard (NUMBER columns would get imported as Double when they should be imported as Int64 or Decimal).
- Semantic Analyzer should no longer report an error when extension columns are used in [SUMMARIZE](https://dax.guide/summarize).
- Semantic Analyzer now reports an error when 'ID' is used as a table reference without quotes.
