## New features in 3.1.0

- The Table Import Wizard is finally here! And it's better than ever before. Read [this article](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/te3/importing-tables.html) for more information. It currently works for SQL, ODBC and OLE DB, but let us know if you need support for other types of data sources.
- Offline (i.e. without being connected to Analysis Services) detection of table schema changes now works - even for M partitions and implicit data sources.
- Objects can now be shown/hidden in perspectives through the TOM context menu, similar to TE2.
- The Import/Export translations option is now available, similar to TE2.
- Added the Batch Rename Dialog, similar to TE2 (the dialog shows up when selecting multiple objects and hitting "F2" for rename).
- Added the Mark as Date Table dialog, similar to TE2.

## Improvements in 3.1.0

- Copying a single cell from a DAX query result now formats the value such that it can be easily pasted into a DAX expression, see [#200](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/200).
- Added "Delete relationship" option to diagram context menu, see [#195](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/195).
- Added "Remove field" option to Pivot Grid context menu.
- Model-wide actions such as Create Table, Refresh, Import Tables, etc. are now available through the "Model" menu.
- AuthenticationKind property on Structured Data Sources now has a dropdown. The Options property can now be edited as well and the Query property has been exposed.
- TOM Explorer context menu items have been rearranged to align better with TE2.
- Role members can now be edited directly by right-clicking on a role.
- Dependencies can now be copied from the Dependency View to either Text/JSON format, similar to TE2.
- New skin palette options for the "Basic" and "Bezier" skins (which are vector based, and thus look much better in Hi-DPI than the VS-like skins). Find the new palettes at the bottom of the "Window" menu.
