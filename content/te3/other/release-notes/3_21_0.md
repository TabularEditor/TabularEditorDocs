> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are no longer providing .NET 6 builds of Tabular Editor 3, as this is [out-of-support as of November 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). If you are not able to install the [.NET 8 Desktop runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime), please contact your IT organization. Alternatively, use our portable builds, which include the required .NET runtime.

## New in 3.21.0

Check out our [release blog](https://tabulareditor.com/blog/tabular-editor-3-april-2025-release) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

## Improvements in 3.21.0

- We've made even more visual tweaks and improvements to our **Diagram view** in this release:
  - Icons visually indicate column data types.
  - Double-arrows when a relationship uses bi-directional cross filtering
  - A chevron button in the top-right corner of the table allows you to quickly toggle between various ways of displaying the columns in the table: All columns, key columns only, or no columns at all.
  - Various font size adjustments and other minor tweaks
- Updated AMO/TOM to the latest version [19.94.1.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices/19.94.1.1).
- We have added a new property on the `Model` object, `MetadataSource`, which includes information about where the model metadata was loaded from. This is useful for C# scripts, for example if a script needs to iterate files in the same folder structure that the model metadata was loaded from. See the [API docs](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/api/TabularEditor.TOMWrapper.Model.html#TabularEditor_TOMWrapper_Model_MetadataSource) for more information.
- DAX Optimizer users can now also view the results for RLS and Calculation Item expressions through our **DAX Optimizer Integration**.
- You can now script individual objects as [TMDL (Tabular Model Definition Language)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tmdl/tmdl-overview?view=asallproducts-allversions) through the **TOM Explorer**. This is useful when you want to copy TMDL scripts from Tabular Editor to Power BI Desktop. Right-click an object and choose **Export script > TMDL**. You'll have the option of exporting the script to a file or directly to the clipboard.

## Bugfixes in 3.21.0

- Sorting by "Progress" or "Duration" in the **Data Refresh** view should now work correctly. Moreover, the "Duration" is no longer reset at the end of the refresh operation, for certain objects.
- Various bugfixes related to the view of progress events in the **Data Refresh** view. For example, progress events should now arrive even if a previous session has expired (for example when Tabular Editor was idle for 60 minutes or more).
- When partition deployment is disabled, or enabled but with incremental refresh partitions skipped, we now also leave the refresh policy settings on the table untouched (i.e. **Source Expression**, **Polling Expression**, etc.)
- The Semantic Analyzer should no longer report an error when tables are connected by only inactive relationships, and a relationship is activated using the [`USERELATIONSHIP`](https://dax.guide/userelationship/) function.
- Fixed a bug where the Semantic Analyzer determined the wrong resulting data type when using the [`GENERATESERIES`](https://dax.guide/generateseries/) function.
- Fixed a bug with the Semantic Analyzer reporting false "not found" errors when [`DEFINE`ing](https://dax.guide/DEFINE) and referencing tables and columns inside a DAX script/query.
- It is no longer possible to assign an empty name to an object through the **TOM Explorer**.
- Certain words that were previously treated as reserved keywords, will no longer produce a semantic error, when used as unquoted table / variable references.
- Fixed a bug where the DAX debugger didn't correctly gray out the inactive branch when using IF.EAGER or IF with only 2 parameters.
- When opening a model with a workspace connection (i.e. Tabular Editor 3's Workspace Mode feature), we now correctly show the Microsoft Entra MFA prompt, if this was the authentication method used when the connection to the workspace database was originally established.
- Our code editors now fully supports wide characters / unicode emojis (note, this is not an endorsement of emojis in DAX, but it is now possible to use them without breaking the editor :)).
- If the .tmuo file contains invalid JSON, Tabular Editor will now show an error message and continue loading the model without the options specified in the file, instead of causing an unhandled exception.
- Fixed a bug where the Refresh Policy options would not appear in the **Properties** grid on a table in a model loaded from disk, if the table did not have any partitions specified in the loaded metadata.
- The `Ctrl+U` (Uncomment Code) and `Ctrl+/` (Toggle comments) shortcuts were not working properly because of conflicts with other editor keyboard shortcuts. We have removed the default shortcuts from the conflicting commands. If you need keyboard bindings for the *Editor.Lowercase* and *Editor.Uppercase* commands (previously `Ctrl+U` and `Ctrl+Shift+U` respectively), you can set these up through **Tools > Preferences > Keyboard**.
