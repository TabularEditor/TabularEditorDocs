Data processors:

 We do not share the information that we collect with third parties, with the following exceptions:

We may engage trusted third party service providers acting as data processors to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the website/app, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the website/app. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.

The data processors will not review, share, distribute, or reference any collected information except to the extent they are so instructed by us. All data processors have implemented security measures to protect against unauthorized access, loss, use or alteration of the information. Further, data processing agreements have been entered into with all data processors. 

Currently we use the following data processors:.

| Name | Location | Purpose of sub-data processing | Which data? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chargebee Inc. | AWS EU Data centre in Frankfurt, Germany | Subscription management, including handling of invoicing. | E-mail addresses, name of contact person, billing address and billing information. |
| Amazon.com Inc. | As above | Hosting of the above- mentioned information on behalf of Chargebee Inc. | As above |
| Microsoft | Azure West EU Data Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands | License management | E-mail address and name of contact person/license administrator |

Other third parties:

We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the website/app in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the website/app. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the website/app and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.

We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.

#### How Do We Use Your Email Address?

By submitting your email address on this website/app, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy.

Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

#### How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Tabular Editor 3 to you and/or fulfil the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can’t identify you.

#### How Do We Protect Your Information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Tabular Editor ApS or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

Credit Card information is collected and processed only by our payment/subscription partner, which currently is Chargebee.com. Tabular Editor ApS does not collect or store Credit Card information.

#### Could my information be transferred to other countries?

Tabular Editor ApS is incorporated in Denmark. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties within the EU/EEA. We do not transfer your information to unsecure third countries, i.e. countries outside of EU/EEA that have not been considered by the Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. 

#### Is the information collected through the Tabular Editor Service secure?

We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are fool proof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.

#### Can I update or correct my information and which other rights to I have?

Customers and users of our website have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows: You can contact us in order to  (1) receive information about which personal data we are processing about you and for what purposes, (2) to have personal information that we are processing about you transferred to another service provider (data portability), if applicable, (3) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (4) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (5) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. 

Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. 

To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.

If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting at the following e-mail address: [contact@tabulareditor.com](mailto:contact@tabulareditor.com). 

You may also use this mail address to withdraw any consents to our processing of your personal data.
