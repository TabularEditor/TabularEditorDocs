# DAX Editor

The **DAX Editor** is the centerpiece of Tabular Editor 3.

It comes in three different *flavours*:

- **Expression Editor** Used for making quick changes to singular DAX expressions on objects in the TOM Explorer.
- **DAX Query** (Connected feature) Used for writing DAX queries in order to retrieve data from the connected instance of Analysis Services / Power BI.
- **DAX Script** Used for viewing and editing DAX expressions and basic properties across multiple objects in a single document.

All three flavours support the same operations in terms of [keyboard shortcuts](xref:shortcuts#dax-code), syntax highlighting, code assist, etc.

## Code Assist features

The main enabler of productivity in Tabular Editor 3's DAX Editor, is its **Parameter Info** and **Auto-Complete** features. Collectively, these are known as **Code Assist** features (other vendors use the term "IntelliSense").

**Parameter Info** provides details about the DAX function and its parameter at the position of the cursor. The information is displayed in a tooltip above the cursor. Hit [Esc] to close the tooltip and [Ctrl+Shift+Space] to display it.

**Auto-Complete** provides context-sensitive suggestions as you type, in a dropdown box. You can use the keyboard to navigate the items in the dropdown and hitting [Enter] or [Tab] will insert the selected item into your code. You can hit [Esc] to close the dropdown and [Ctrl+Space] to open it.

These features can also be invoked through the context menu of the editor.

Most aspects of code assist can be configured under [**Tools > Preferences > Text Editors > DAX Editor > Code Assist**](xref:preferences#dax-editor--code-assist).

## Peek Definition

While the cursor is over an object reference such as a variable or a measure reference, hit [Alt+F12] to display an inline editor with the definition of that object, below the cursor. This is useful when you want to see the DAX code of a referenced object without leaving the current position in the document.

## Go To Definition

Instead of peeking, we can also jump straight to the location where the referenced object is defined. To do this, hit [F12]. If the referenced object is not defined within the current document, this operation will jump over to that object in the TOM Explorer. If needed, you can navigate back using [Alt+Left Arrow].

# Define Measure

For DAX scripts and DAX queries, it is sometimes useful to include the definition of a measure that is referenced elsewhere in the code. The **Define Measure** feature lets you do that when the cursor is over a measure reference. You may also choose the **Define Measure with Dependencies** option if you want to include all downstream measure references as well.

# Inline Measure

If you want to bring the definition of a measure into the current document, the **Inline Measure** feature lets you do just that. When a row context is surronding the original measure reference, Tabular Editor automatically surrounds the measure expression with [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/calculate) (which is implicit in measure references).

# Format DAX

The DAX Editor in Tabular Editor 3 automatically formats your code as you type, i.e. fixing casing of functions and object references, adding proper indentation and spaces between parentheses, etc. All of this can be configured under [**Tools > Preferences > Text Editors > DAX Editor > Auto Formatting**](xref:preferences#dax-editor--auto-formatting).

However, sometimes it is necessary to format the entire document. This can be done by hitting [F6] or [Shift+F6] if you prefer more frequent line breaks. For DAX Queries, you may also use [Alt+F6] to reformat the code to always add commas at the front of a line, which is useful when debugging. 

# Refactoring

If you want to change the name of a variable or extension column, you can use the **Refactor** option (Ctrl+R) while the cursor is located on the variable or extension column reference. This will select all instances of that object, allowing you to rename it everywhere at once.

# Configurable keyboard shortcuts

The DAX Editor and code editors in general are highly configurable and support a lot of additional commands for quickly and productively editing code. You can view all of these commands, as well as modify and assign keyboard shortcuts under **Tools > Preferences > Tabular Editor > Keyboard**.
