## Editing properties
The Property Grid on the lower right side of the screen, shows most of the properties for the object(s) selected in the Explorer Tree. If you select multiple objects at once, the Property Grid lets you simultaneously edit properties for the selected objects. This is useful for example when setting the Format String property. Examples of properties you can set through the Property Grid:

* Name (you can rename objects directly in the Explorer Tree by hitting F2)
* Description
* Display Folder (can also be renamed directly in the Explorer Tree, also [drag/drop](drag-drop.md))
* Hidden (can be set for multiple objects through the right-click context menu in the Explorer Tree)
* Format String

Different properties exist, depending on what kind of object was selected.
