## Drag and drop objects
By far the most useful feature of Tabular Editor, when working on models with many measures/columns organised in display folders. Check out the animation below:

![](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/blob/master/Documentation/DragDropFolders.gif)

Notice how the display folder property of every single object below the folder is changed, when the entire folder is dragged. No more going over measures/columns one-by-one, to change the display folder structure. What you see is what you get.

(This works with translations too!)
