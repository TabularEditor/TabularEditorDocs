## Import/Export Translations
Select one or more cultures in the Explorer Tree, right-click and choose "Export Translations..." to generate a .json file that can be imported later in either Tabular Editor or Visual Studio. Choose "Import Translations..." to import a corresponding .json file. You can choose whether to overwrite existing translations. If you don't, translations defined in the .json file will only be applied to objects that do not already have a translation for the given culture.
