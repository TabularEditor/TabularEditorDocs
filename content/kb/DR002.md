# Use aggregator instead of iterator

Code action `DR002` (Readability) **Use aggregator instead of iterator**

## Description

Use an aggregator function instead of an iterator function when possible, to simplify the code.

### Example

Change:
```dax
SUMX(Sales, Sales[Line Amount])
```
To:
```dax
SUM(Sales[Line Amount])
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

When you need to aggregate the values of a single column only, aggregator functions ([`SUM`](https://dax.guide), [`MIN`](https://dax.guide), [`MAX`](https://dax.guide), etc.) use simpler, more concise syntax, than their equivalent iterator functions ([`SUMX`](https://dax.guide), [`MINX`](https://dax.guide), [`MAXX`](https://dax.guide), etc.) and should be preferred to make the code more readable.
