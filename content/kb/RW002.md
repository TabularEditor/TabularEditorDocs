# Rewrite using FILTER

Code action `RW002` (Rewrites) **Rewrite using FILTER**

## Description

A scalar predicate in a filter argument to `CALCULATE` is equivalent to a 1-column table expression that uses `FILTER`.

### Example 1

Change:
```dax
CALCULATE([Total Sales], Products[Color] = "Red")
```

To:
```dax
CALCULATE(
	[Total Sales],
	FILTER(
		ALL(Products[Color]), 
		Products[Color] = "Red")
	)
)
```

### Example 2

Change:
```dax
CALCULATE([Total Sales], KEEPFILTERS(Products[Color] = "Red"))
```

To:
```dax
CALCULATE(
	[Total Sales],
	FILTER(
		VALUES(Products[Color]), 
		Products[Color] = "Red")
	)
)
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

This rewrite is useful in case you want to add more complex filtering logic.

> [!NOTE]
> This code action is in the **Rewrites** category, which means that it does not represent a general recommendation or best practice. Instead, the code action provides a quick way to rewrite the code in a different way, for example as part of a larger refactoring. After applying the code action and until further edits are made, you may see an **Improvement** or **Readability** code action that suggests to modify the code back to its original state.
