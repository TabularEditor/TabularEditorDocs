# Remove unnecessary BLANK

Code action `DR012` (Readability) **Remove unnecessary BLANK**

## Description

Some DAX functions, such as [`IF`](https://dax.guide/IF) and [`SWITCH`](https://dax.guide/SWITCH) already return [`BLANK()`](https://dax.guide/BLANK) when the condition is false, so there is no need to explicitly specify `BLANK()`.

### Example

Change:
```dax
SWITCH(
    Document[Type],
    "Invoice", [Invoice Amount],
    "Credit Note", [Credit Note Amount],
    BLANK()
)
```

To:
```dax
SWITCH(
    Document[Type],
    "Invoice", [Invoice Amount],
    "Credit Note", [Credit Note Amount]
)
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

The `BLANK()` function is redundant when used as the last argument in an `IF` or `SWITCH` function, as these functions already return `BLANK()` when the condition is false. By removing the `BLANK()` function, the code becomes more concise and easier to read.
