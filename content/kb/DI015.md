# Replace IF with DIVIDE

Code action `DI015` (Improvement) **Replace IF with DIVIDE**

## Description

Use the [`DIVIDE`](https://dax.guide/DIVIDE) function instead of [`IF`](https://dax.guide/IF), to more easily check for zero or blank in the demoninator.

### Example 1

Change:
```dax
IF([Total Cost] = 0, BLANK(), [Total Sales] / [Total Cost])
```
To:
```dax
DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Cost])
```

### Example 2

Change:
```dax
IF([Total Cost] <> 0, [Total Sales] / [Total Cost])
```
To:
```dax
DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Cost])
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

The `DIVIDE` function is a more concise and readable way to handle division by zero or blank values. By using `DIVIDE`, you make your code more robust and easier to understand. Moreover, the `DIVIDE` function is more efficient than using `IF` to check for zero or blank values, as it only evaluates the denominator once.
