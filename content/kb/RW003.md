# Invert IF

Code action `RW003` (Rewrites) **Invert IF**

## Description

To improve readability, it is sometimes useful to invert `IF` statements.

### Example

Change:
```dax
IF(a < b, "B is greater", "A is greater")
```

To:
```dax
IF(a > b, "A is greater", "B is greater")
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

This code action provides a quick way to invert the logic of an `IF` statement, which can make the code easier to read. The readability of the code is subjective and depends on the context, which is why this code action is in the **Rewrites** category rather than the **Readability** category.
