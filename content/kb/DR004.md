# Prefix variable

Code action `DR004` (Readability) **Prefix variable**

## Description

It is recommended to use a consistent prefix for variables, to more easily distinguish them from table references. The default prefix is `_`, but you can configure which prefix to use, to match your preferred style, under **Tools > Preferences > DAX Editor > Code Actions**.

### Example

Change:
```dax
VAR sales = SUM('Internet Sales'[Sales Amount])
RETURN sales * 1.25;
```
To:
```dax
VAR _sales = SUM('Internet Sales'[Sales Amount])
RETURN _sales * 1.25;
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

This code action is designed to improve the readability of your DAX code. By using a consistent naming convention for your variables, it is easier to understand the purpose of each variable, and to distinguish between variables and tables.

Moreover, using a special character (such as an underscore) as a prefix for variables can help to avoid naming conflicts with table names, in case a table with the same name as the variable is added to the model in the future.

## Remarks

This code action has an **(All occurrences)** variant, which will appear when multiple sections of code can be improved. This variant will apply the code action to all relevant sections of the document at once.
