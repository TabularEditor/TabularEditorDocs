# Rewrite using DISTINCTCOUNT

Code action `DR009` (Readability) **Rewrite using DISTINCTCOUNT**

## Description

Instead of using a combination of [`COUNTROWS`](https://dax.guide/COUNTROWS) and [`DISTINCT`](https://dax.guide/DISTINCT) to count the number of distinct values in a column, use the [`DISTINCTCOUNT`](https://dax.guide/DISTINCTCOUNT) function.

### Example

Change:
```dax
COUNTROWS(DISTINCT(Sales[CalendarDate]))
```
```

To:
```dax
DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CalendarDate])
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

While both options produce the same result and the same query plan (i.e. identical performance), the `DISTINCTCOUNT` function is more concise and easier to read than the combination of `COUNTROWS` and `DISTINCT`. By using `DISTINCTCOUNT`, the code becomes more readable and the intent of the expression is clearer.
