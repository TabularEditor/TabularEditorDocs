# Use division instead of DIVIDE

Code action `DI013` (Improvement) **Use division instead of DIVIDE**

## Description

When the 2nd argument of [`DIVIDE`](https://dax.guide/DIVIDE) is a non-zero constant, it is more efficient to use the division operator.

### Example

Change:
```dax
DIVIDE([Total Sales], 1.25)
```
To:
```dax
[Total Cost] / 1.25
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

The `DIVIDE` function is a robust way to handle division by zero errors, as it returns a specific value or (Blank) if the denominator is zero. However, when the denominator is guaranteed to be non-zero, such as when dividing by a (non-zero) constant, the division operator `/` is more efficient and easier to read. By using the division operator, the code becomes more concise and easier to understand.
