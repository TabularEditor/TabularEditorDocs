Code action `DR007` (Readability) **Simplify 1-variable block**

## Description

A variable block with only one variable can be simplified by moving the expression directly into the `RETURN` part of the block. This assumes the variable is only referenced once without any context modifiers.

### Example

Change:
```dax
VAR _sales = [Total Sales]
RETURN
    _sales * 1.25
```
To:
```dax
[Total Sales] * 1.25
```

## Why is Tabular Editor suggesting this?

When variable declarations are sufficiently simple, and when the variable is used exactly once in the `RETURN` part of the code without any context modifications, there is no need to declare the variable at all. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
