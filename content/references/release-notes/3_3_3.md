## Important!

**NOTE**: Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Improvements in 3.3.3

- **The Import Table Wizard now allows you to import tables from a Power BI Dataflow.** Note that this option is only available when working on Power BI datasets. Moreover, Tabular Editor can now perform a schema update of tables based on Power BI dataflows, even when working offline (i.e. when not connected to the Power BI XMLA endpoint).
- C# scripts: Entering a closing parenthesis or bracket now closes the auto-complete box. Moreover, the pre-selection of the auto-complete box based on the current search string has been improved.
- C# scripts: Runtime error messages now include stack traces, making debugging easier.
- The default compatibility level for new Power BI datasets is now 1570.
- Under **Tools > Preferences > File formats**, we now have a set of options that allow you to specify the default compatibility level and whether or not to use a workspace database, when creating a new model.
- Instead of throwing a connection error, SQL server connections that fail because of an untrusted certificate, now prompt you if you want to trust the certificate and reconnect.
- It is now possible to disable automatic formula fix-up (under Tools > Preferences > Modeling Operations), see also [#595](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/595).
- Added an .msi version of the installer, which is useful for unattended installations or installations through software packaging.
- 32 bit installers should now allow installation on 64 bit systems (but not vice versa).
- Added "Lock column width" right-click menu option on TOM Explorer, table preview, VertiPaq analyzer, etc. When checked, columns are always resized to match the width of the grid, changing the behavior of "Best fit (All columns)". This solves issue [#603](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/603) and also addresses one of the suggestions in [#595](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/595).
- More column options in DAX query results, when right-clicking on a result column header. For example, you can hide/show columns, display a find panel for quickly filtering using a text string, and even group by columns to display the query results hierarchically. Note that sorting/grouping/filtering of query results only happens locally on the cached result (which is typically the first 1000 rows of a query). Adjust your DAX query if you need to perform these operations on the full set of data.
- BPA rules can now be downloaded from URLs using basic authentication, see [#604](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/604).

## Bugfixes in 3.3.3

- Fix several issues related to macro compilation/execution, see [#587](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/587) and [#573](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/573).
- Fix issue with calls to `FormatDax` through scripts not working when using daxformatter.com, see [#592](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/592).
- Fix issue with scripts not able to call the Error and Warning global methods
- Fix issue with macros not being able to compile when the code contains an aliased using directive
- Fix issue with macros NullReferenceException when calling methods like EvaluateDax, etc.
- Fixed syntax highlighting of unquoted table references which are also keywords (for example 'Currency' is valid as an unquoted table reference in DAX, but it was previously colored as if it was a keyword)
- Got rid of the Visual C++ Redistributable dependency, which, when not installed, caused Tabular Editor to crash often.

## Bugfixes in 3.3.2

- Fixed a bug in the installer, which caused some files not to be updated when performing an in-place upgrade, which in turn could cause application crashes and other issues, see [#586](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/586).
- Added support for the `ExpressionSource` property on the [NamedExpression](xref:TabularEditor.TOMWrapper.NamedExpression) class.

## Improvements in 3.3.1

- New Installer which automatically downloads and installs missing .NET Runtime and VC++ prerequisites, if they are missing.
- Added support for the DAX [`NETWORKDAYS`](https://dax.guide/NETWORKDAYS/) function.
- Updated TOM to [19.42.0.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64/)

## Bugfixes in 3.3.1

- Fixed an issue with C# tooltips not showing xmldoc comments, unless application launched from installation folder.
- Semantic Analyzer now correctly reports an error when using special MDX reserved keywords as unquoted table references.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to deploy a model loaded from a .pbit file would fial.
- Fixed an issue with compilation of C# scripts and macros. See [#570](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/570), [#573](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/573) and [#580](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/580).
- Fixed an issue that prevented loading models containing calculation groups with one or more erroneous measures, see [#571](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/571).
- Fixed an issue with the diagram not automatically refreshing after reloading a model, see [#572](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/572).
- Fixed an issue that prevented the C# script engine from importing certain DLLs, see [#574](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/574). 
- Fixed an issue that prevented connecting to Power BI Desktop after making a choice in the "Local instances" dropdown, see [#579](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/579).
- Fixed an issue where the TOM Explorer would select all objects (even when filtering the TOM Explorer), when pressing CTRL+A, see [#582](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/582).
- Various stability improvements based on anonymous telemetry/error reports.

## Improvements in 3.3.0

- Updated TOM to [19.39.2.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64/)
- Tabular Editor 3 now uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) for C# script compilation. This means that your C# scripts can now use all the wonderful new language features of [C# 10.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10). Moreover, you can define classes and other types directly within your scripts. Last but not least, we finally have Roslyn-powered **code completion** and **calltips** for C# scripts (see screenshot).
  ![Csharp Intellisense](~/content/assets/images/csharp-intellisense.png)
- On a similar note, make sure to check out our new [Scripting API](xref:api-index) docs site, where you'll find up-to-date documentation for all of the objects and members you can access through Tabular Editor 3's C# scripting feature.
- We also have a great improvement for the auto complete feature in our DAX editors, which will now show tooltips providing more information about the objects in the auto complete list. The tooltip will show the `Description` of measures, columns, etc. If no description is specified, we'll show the first 10 lines of DAX code on the object:
  ![Dax Intellisense Improv](~/content/assets/images/dax-intellisense-improv.png)
- When opening a model from Analysis Services or the Power BI XMLA endpoint, we now provide options to help you avoid making changes to the model by mistake, which is useful when you have multiple instances of Tabular Editor 3 open. The **Mode** dropdown (see screenshot below) lets you open a model in read-only or read/refresh-only mode. The **Status bar color** dropdown lets you set a color for Tabular Editor 3's status bar, so you can easily distinguish for example production, test, and dev models that are simultaneously open in different instances of Tabular Editor. See [#558](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/558).
  ![New Open Fromdb Options](~/content/assets/images/new-open-fromdb-options.png)
- We have finally added the "Duplicate object" context menu option (Ctrl+D) in the TOM Explorer, see [#501](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/501).
- Added support for Snowflake OAuth and ExternalBrowser authentication, see [#546](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/546).
- Property grid now has a search bar.
- Added more proxy configuration options under **Tools** > **Preferences** > **Proxy Settings**.
- Updated SQL Native Client library to the latest version. Connections to SQL Server now require encryption by default (unless connecting to localhost).
- Added a **Refresh clear** option at the model, table and partition levels, see [#511](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/511).
- Added checkbox to open data models without workspace database, [#523](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/523).


## Bugfixes in 3.3.0

- "**Update table schema...**" will now correctly deal with columns where the name has only changed in casing.
- TE3 Business Edition now prevents adding multiple partitions/perspectives to AS models (which will prevent TE3 from loading the same model later due to edition restrictions).
- Fixed an issue where editor actions would sometimes be disabled, see [#519](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/519).
- Fixed an issue with the **Cancel** and **Cancel All** buttons not being enabled after starting a refresh operation.
