### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New in 3.14.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2024/02/20/tabular-editor-3-february-2024-release/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

## Improvements in 3.14.0

- Calculated columns now show the "*fx*" glyph in the Table Preview, so they are easier to distinguish from non-calculated columns.
- The DAX query row limiter will now be disabled if a DAX query uses [`TOPN`](https://dax.guide/TOPN) or [`START AT`](https://dax.guide/st/start-at/), to avoid interfering with the returned results.
- The DAX auto-complete feature now supports any scalar expression in the [`ORDER BY`](https://dax.guide/st/order-by/) clause of a DAX query, and will also no longer suggest columns that are already specified earlier in the [`ORDER BY`](https://dax.guide/st/order-by/) clause.
- When importing/updating tables in a Direct Lake model, we now add the same annotations to tables and columns as if the model was created through the Power BI web modelling, ensuring that cross workspace models can refresh without issues, among other things.
- Support for [DAX `INFO` functions](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/dax-query-view-introduces-new-info-dax-functions/) in editor auto-complete. These functions are only suggested in a DAX query, as they cannot be used in calculated items (e.g., columns, tables) or measures in a model.
- Updated TOM to [19.76.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64) which includes the latest version of TMDL (Preview-9).
- With TMDL Preview-9, we now have a set of new options available, for configuring how the TMDL is serialized. You can find these options under **Tools > Preferences > Save-to-folder** (for any models that were previously saved as TMDL, you can change these settings under **Model > Serialization options**):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TMDL is still a preview feature, meaning breaking changes could be introduced between new releases. If you face any issues deserializing a model after upgrading Tabular Editor, rollback to the latest version of Tabular Editor, then temporarily save the model as a regular .bim file, before serializing it to TMDL again using the latest version of Tabular Editor.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not currently have any options available for customizing which objects get serialized as individual files, when using TMDL. If you would like to see this feature, [please let us know](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/discussions/1198#discussioncomment-8382137)!

## Bugfixes in 3.14.0

- Fixed an issue with Find/Replace unexpectedly searching/performing replaces outside of the current selection.
- Fixed an issue where the DAX autocomplete would not suggest a column after a binary operator, if that column was already used previously in the same filter expression, see [#1156](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1156).
- Fixed an issue where unpinning the **Properties View** would cause all layout settings to be reset upon reopening TE3.
- The DAX Semantic Analyzer now properly handles [`ORDER BY`](https://dax.guide/st/order-by/) and [`START AT`](https://dax.guide/st/start-at/) expressions in DAX queries. Moreover, auto-complete works correctly within these clauses, and the automatic row limiter no longer generates invalid DAX when [`START AT`](https://dax.guide/st/start-at/) is present. See [#1182](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1182). Lastly, the built-in DAX formatter should no longer crash when formatting a query containing [`START AT`](https://dax.guide/st/start-at/).
- Fixed a bug where the Data Preview grid seemed to support sorting by more than column. In reality, only the first column selected for sorting is effective, since the [`TOPNSKIP`](https://dax.guide/topnskip) function used to query the table does not support sorting on more than column.
- Fixed a bug that would cause documents to get "stuck" when restoring a layout through the **Window** menu.
- Fixed a bug that prevented certain types of errors to be shown in the **TOM Explorer** and the **Messages** view, see [1217](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1217).
- Fixed a bug that could cause the application to hang during activation.
- Fixed an issue with extended properties on perspectives not being serialized when using (legacy) "Save to folder", see [#1165](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/issues/1165).
- Entering a '.' (dot) should no longer close the DAX auto-complete popup window when filtering DAX functions that have a dot in their name.
