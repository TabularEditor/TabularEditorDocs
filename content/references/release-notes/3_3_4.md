## Important!

**NOTE**: Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Improvements in 3.3.4

- Updated TOM to v. [19.46.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64).
- Updated Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to v. [5.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient).
- Updated SciLexer.dll to v. 4.4.6, which is not affected by [this CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2019-16294).
- Multiple minor fixes and improvements.
- New/Edit Relationship dialog improvements: Columns are sorted alphabetically and by matching type. We now also suggest the "to-column" based on the name of the "from-column".
- Changed default CL for new Power BI datasets to 1571 and added support for the [ObjectTranslation.Altered](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.objecttranslation.altered?view=analysisservices-dotnet) property, which should be set to "true" to prevent metadata translations from being overwritten from the source, when creating DirectQuery over AS datasets.
- Added a new shortcut, **Ctrl+Alt+S**, to save the current model. See [#595](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/595), [#561](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/561).
- Added shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+F6** for Debug Comma DAX formatting. See [#595](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/595).
- Offline Schema Detection should now work when parameters such as Server Name and Database Name are stored in shared M expressions.

## Bugfixes in 3.3.4

- Fixed an issue where the Udate Table Schema option would report all columns as removed, see [#612](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/612).
- Fix false semantic analyzer errors when using nested filter expressions.
- Fix false semantic analyzer errors when using `NATURALINNERJOIN` / `NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN` on tables that are joind by relationships instead of common columns.
- Fix issue when trying to show connection dialog for ODBC connectors, see [#448](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/448)
- AAD authentication with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient now displays a modal popup (instead of opening the OS browser)
- Fix issue with SQL Server connection dialog "advanced button" sometimes causing a crash.
- Table Import Wizard now allows previewing data on Azure Synapse (the NOLOCK hint is no longer added to the data preview query)
- 32 bit installer should now correctly check for the 32 bit .NET Desktop Runtime
- DAX autocomplete can now also suggest Variant-typed scalar variables, see [#615](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/615)
- Fixed an issue with the DAX debugger not being able to display local/watch expressions with nested conditional branches.
- Include SciLexer.dll in application folder instead of extracting/Loading it to %LocalAppData%\Temp. Should prevent the "Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation" error seen sometimes when group policy prevents loading DLLs from this location.
- Fixed an issue with the Property Grid not being able to set nested properties on multiple selections. See [#614](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/614).
- Fixed an issue where the Property Grid did not refresh to show dynamically added/removed properties, for example when toggling the "Incremental Refresh Policy" property.
- Fixed an issue where an AAS Developer Tier instance would be regarded as a Standard Tier instance, preventing connectivity with TE3 Business Edition
- Fix issue with NAMEOF autocomplete not showing all column/measure references in some situations, see [#620](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/620).
- Fixed an issue with certain DAX keywords (START, ORDER, RETURN, etc.) not being treated as an error, when used as table references without quotes. This bug also prevented proper formatting of code containing a quoted reference to such tables.
- Fixed the "4096 (0x1000) is an invalid culture identifier", see [#576](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/576).
- Prevent find/replace search crash, see [#611](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/611).
- Show all properties when in read-only mode, see [#596](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/596).
- Removed animation for pinned/unpinned windows, see [#595](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/595).
- Don't autobrace in DAX comments, see [#597](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/597).
- Fix issue with default CL value causing crash in Preferences dialog when set to a non-standard value.
