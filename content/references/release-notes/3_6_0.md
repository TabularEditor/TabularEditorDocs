### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New in 3.6.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/04/19/tabular-editor-3-april-2023-release/) to get an overview of the most important updates in this release.

- Tabular Editor 3 now has native support for **Databricks**. This means you can now connect to a Databricks SQL endpoint when importing tables using the Table Import Wizard. For more information, see our [release blog post](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/04/19/tabular-editor-3-april-2023-release).
- We added support for the new DAX functions [`RANK`](https://dax.guide/rank) and [`ROWNUMBER`](https://dax.guide/rownumber) introduced in the [April 2023 update of Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-april-2023-feature-summary/). In addition, our code complete now shows all available keywords for the &lt;Blanks&gt; and &lt;Order&gt; arguments of the window and [`ORDERBY`](https://dax.guide/orderby) functions.

## Minor improvements in 3.6.0

- We no longer perform a (potentiallys slow) conflict check before saving changes to the workspace database. The assumption is that each developer uses their own personal workspace database, so conflicts should not occur.
- C# scripting: The `IAnnotationObject` interface has been extended with a `ClearAnnotations()` method.
- When adding a dynamic format string expression to a measure, we now clear the static format string property (as it is not possible for measures to have both static and dynamic format strings assigned).
- Updated TOM to [19.61.1.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64).
- Default Compatibility Level for new Power BI models created with Tabular Editor, is now 1601. Moreover, the "create new model" dialog now lets you specify any compatibility level.

## Bugfixes in 3.6.0

- Oracle download instructions updated to instruct users to use the ODAC (not ODP.NET) drivers.
- Removed restrictions on special characters in database names, when opening or creating a new database.
- Fixed an issue that caused the database name property within the .bim / database.json file, to be updated with the name of the workspace database.
- DAX debugger stability improvements.
- .tmuo files are no longer saved, when the "Create user options (.tmuo) file" option is unchecked.
- Fixed an issue where code complete would sometimes "absorb" closing brackets.
- Semantic Analyzer no longer reports an error when using [`SELECTEDMEASURE`](https://dax.guide/selectedmeasure) (and related functions) in the context of measure expressions and format string expressions.
- Fixed an issue where the M query generated for new tables imported from an existing implicit (SQL) data source, would not work correctly when attempting to refresh the table.
