### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Bugfixes in 3.4.2

- Fixed an issue with the Semantic Analyzer reporting "circular dependency" errors, when there are none. See [#811](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/811).
- Find/Replace should no longer replace all occurrences in the document, when setting "Look in" to "Selection", see [#293](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/293).
- Copy/pasting cultures between models should no longer cause a crash, see issue [#798](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/798). Note that ObjectTranslations referring to objects that do not exist in the destination model, are deleted.
- DAX debugger should now allow inspecting multi-row watch expressions in all cases.
- DAX debugger should no longer crash when attempting to debug the result of a query such as `EVALUATE { [Measure that uses ALLSELECTED] }`
