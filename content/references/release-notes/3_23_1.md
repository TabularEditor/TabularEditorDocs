> [!NOTE]
> We are now providing native [ARM64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) builds in addition to regular 64-bit (x64) builds. 32-bit (x86) builds have been discontinued.

## New in 3.23.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

- Tabular Editor 3 now supports **DAX User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**. This is a big, important feature, and we can't do it justice in a few bullet points. Please check out the [dedicated documentation section](xref:udfs) to learn more.
- As if one big feature wasn't enough, we also added support for **Calendars** in this release, including DAX parser and editor support for 8 new DAX functions related to week-based time intelligence. Again, please see the [dedicated documentation section](xref:calendars) to learn more.

## Improvements in 3.23.1

- We added Compatibility Level 1700 (SQL Server 2025) to the dropdown in the **New Model** dialog. Moreover, the default Compatibility Level for Power BI models has been updated to 1702 (which is needed for UDFs and Calendars).

## Bugfixes in 3.23.1

- This update fixes several bugs related to UDFs and Calendars compared to 3.23.0. Mostly related to our built-in DAX parser, but also several tweaks and stability improvements for things like autocomplete, formatting, etc.
- We have downgraded the version of MSAL (Microsoft.Identity.Client) library to [4.72.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client/4.72.1), as the newer versions of this library (used in the previous release of Tabular Editor 3), do not work well with the AS client library, [causing the application to hang when using the Microsoft Entra ID authentication option](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1485).
- Removed the **Duplicate** and **Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete** actions for Calculated Table Columns, as these objects cannot be manually added/removed from tables, and doing so would cause issues upon saving the changes to Analysis Services / Power BI. You should modify the DAX of the calculated table instead.
- Mirrored Azure Databricks catalogs are now also shown in the Table Import Wizard UI, when choosing the **Fabric Mirrored Database** option.
- Fixed an issue where opening a model created with older versions of Power BI Desktop would cause a "The given key 'Extended Properties' was not present in the dictionary" error.
- Fixed a bug that prevented forward references in DAX script object properties. I.e. you no longer get an error if the `FormatString` property of a measure references a measure defined later in the script.
