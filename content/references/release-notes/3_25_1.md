> [!NOTE]
> We are now providing native [ARM64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) builds in addition to regular 64-bit (x64) builds. 32-bit (x86) builds have been discontinued.

## New in 3.25.0
Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

- Tabular Editor is now available in [**Chinese and Spanish (Preview)**](xref:references-application-language). All translations have initially been done with AI, with human proofreading. Japanese, German and French are also available as experimental languages, which are not yet reviewed.
- Tabular Editor now includes a set of [**built-in Best Practice Analyzer (BPA) rules**](xref:built-in-bpa-rules) covering key best practices across formatting, metadata, model layout, DAX expressions, and translations.
- Tabular Editor now includes the **Semantic Bridge** feature, which lets you easily create semantic models from Databricks [Metric Views](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/metric-views/) (*Tabular Editor 3 Enterprise Edition only*).
- Added an option to save semantic models with [**supporting files for Fabric**](xref:save-with-supporting-files). When enabled, Tabular Editor can create and update the .platform and definition.pbism files alongside the model metadata to match Fabric repository structure.
- This release also adds a new **Calendar Editor**, that makes it easy to manage the calendar objects used for Calendar-based time intelligence.
- Last but not least, we've added an [**Advanced Refresh**](xref:advanced-refresh) dialog, through which you can configure advanced refresh options like parallelism and effective date for incremental refresh. You can also specify [refresh override profiles](xref:refresh-overrides) (*Tabular Editor 3 Business Edition and Enterprise Edition only*).

## Improvements in 3.25.0

- Added support for setting the CustomData property of the connection string directly from the Impersonation dialog.
- DAX Package Manager View now downloads and shows DaxLib package icons.
- DAX Package Manager now caches package metadata which allows it to show package info without needing internet connection.
- We've updated the AS client library to the latest version [19.108.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices/19.108.5). This update lets you control the new [UnicodeCharacterBehavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.database.unicodecharacterbehavior?view=analysisservices-dotnet#microsoft-analysisservices-tabular-database-unicodecharacterbehavior) property on the Database object.
- Added Power BI specific Column Data Categories Longitude, Latitude and Place.
- We now show an error message if you attempt to set the Compatibility Level of a model to a value that is not supported by the server. This is to prevent unexpected errors later on when saving changes to the model. If you need to set an unsupported Compatibility Level for migration purposes, save your model metadata to disk (in .bim or TMDL format), then open the metadata with no workspace database attached.
- User Options (.tmuo) files, are now also saved when you open a model directly from a server / XMLA-endpoint. The files are stored in your %LocalAppData%\TabularEditor3\UserOptions folder. 
- Added a "Refresh full (ignore policy)" option to the data refresh context menu, so that you can easily refresh data into existing partitions, without triggering partition add/delete/merge operations on the server, when a table is governed by incremental refresh policy. 
- Reorganized the options in the data refresh context menu, to bring the most commonly used options to the top. 
- Added Start time to refresh pane making it possible to sort the refresh after when they started e.g. seeing the latest refresh first.
- Added a search pane to the Preferences dialog to quickly search for individual preferences.
- Added "User Defined Functions" and "Calendars" to Best Practice Rule editor list.
- Added a `UsedInCalendars` property to columns, making it easy to check inside a C# script, if a column is used in any calendar objects.
- "File > Close" menu action is renamed to "Close Document" and is now capable of closing any panel or document in the main document area. **Ctrl + W** is assigned as the default shortcut.
- Added Semantic Analyzer support for the new `ENDALIGNED` keyword of the [`DATEADD`](https://dax.guide/DATEADD) <extension> parameter. [More information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/dateadd-function-dax#extension-parameter-for-small--large-period-shifts).
- When saving to a model.bim or TMDL folder structure with the **Ignore incremental refresh partitions** serialization option enabled, we now add a dummy partition to replace the PolicyRange partitions. This ensures that the model can still be loaded in Power BI Desktop, as no tables are saved without partitions.

## Bugfixes in 3.25.0

- Fixed a critical issue preventing some customers from connecting to the Power BI REST API or Databricks using Azure AD authentication.
- Fixed an unhandled exception that would occur when deleting a column that was also used in a calendar object.
- Fixed relationship editor column dropdown so it automatically shows the whole column names. 
- When a table containing one or more calendars is duplicated, calendars are now automatically renamed to ensure unique names across the model.
- Multiple errors/warnings encountered during a data refresh operation should no longer trigger an unhandled exception.
- Fixed DAX package list showing stale info after performing "Update All".
- Fixed a bug with the `SchemaName` property of Entity Partitions not being undoable.
- Code Action [DI005 - Rewrite table filter as scalar predicate](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/kb/DI005.html) is no longer suggested when [table expansion](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/expanded-tables-in-dax/) takes place, as rewriting such a filter into a column filter would not necessarily produce the same result.
- Clicking the ellipsis button next to the Connection String property should no longer cause an unhandled exception when the connection string specifies an OLE DB provider that is not installed on the current system.
- TMDL exports now correctly exclude incremental refresh partitions when the relevant preference is enabled, matching JSON behavior.
- Fixed an issue where clicking the "Sign in..." button when attempting to update or import from Dataflows, would show the following error message: `This page is not normally shown and could be a sign of a phishing attempt.`

## Bugfixes in 3.25.1

- Fixed some strings that incorrectly indicated that built-in BPA rules were only available for Enterprise Edition.
