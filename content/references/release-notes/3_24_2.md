## Improvements in 3.24.1

- Added Semantic Analyzer support for new data type keywords `LOGICAL`, `INT64`, `DECIMAL`, and `TEXT` (which are all aliases of existing keywords) that can be used as arguments of functions such as [`CONVERT`](https://dax.guide/convert) and [`DATATABLE`](https://dax.guide/datatable).
- Added Semantic Analyzer support for new functions, [`ISINTEGER`](https://dax.guide/isinteger), [`ISCURRENCY`](https://dax.guide/iscurrency), and visual calculation function [`LOOKUPWITHTOTALS`](https://dax.guide/lookupwithtotals).
- Added "Manage DAX Packages..." menu option when right-clicking on the **Model** or **Functions** node in the TOM Explorer.

## Bugfixes in 3.24.1

- Fixed a bug that caused an unhandled exception when launching Tabular Editor 3 on a monitor with a low pixel resolution
- Fixed a bug that prevented opening a model from a PBIP folder structure, when using the **File > Open > Model from File...** menu option, see [#1507](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1507).
- Fixed DPI scaling issues related to the DAX Package Manager view.
- Fixed Semantic Analyzer bug where visual calculation functions [`FIRST`](https://dax.guide/first) and [`LAST`](https://dax.guide/last) were not recognized.
- Fixed Semantic Analyzer bug that would show a false warning when calling an UDF as the first argument of [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/calculate), see [#1509](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1509).
- DAX Package Manager no longer shows a warning because of differences in line endings in the DAX expression (PBI Desktop may change `\n` to `\r\n` when saving a model).
