> [!NOTE] 
>Tabular Editor 2 is no longer under active development and will not receive any major feature additions or improvements from our side. We are, however, committed to keeping it up-to-date, ensuring support for new semantic modelling features as they are released from Microsoft, and also fixing any critical or blocking issues. As the project is open-source under MIT, anyone is welcome to submit pull requests, which will be reviewed and approved by our team.
