# Code Actions

Tabular Editor 3.18.0 introduces a new feature called **Code Actions**. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled in the **Tools > Preferences** dialog under **Text Editors > DAX Editor > Code Actions**.

Code Actions is a productivity feature that discretely provides suggestions for improving your DAX code. You can apply the suggestions with a single click. Code Actions also provides easy access to common code refactoring operations.

Code Actions are separated into three different categories:

1. **Improvements**: These are recommended suggestions for improving your DAX code in terms of:
   - Following best practices
   - Avoiding common pitfalls and anti-patterns
   - Avoiding obsolete or deprecated DAX features
   - Writing better, more performant DAX code
2. **Readability**: These are suggestions for making your DAX code more readable by...
   - Simplifying complex expressions, when possible
   - Remove redundant or unnecessary code
   - Applying consistent formatting and naming conventions
3. **Rewrites**: These are suggestions for refactoring your DAX code. They are not necessarily improvements but are often useful for larger code refactorings. Examples are:
   - Convert DAX "syntax sugar" to more verbose but more explicit code
   - Rename all occurrences of a variable or an extension column
   - Format code

## How to use Code Actions

A new command and corresponding toolbar/menu buttons have been added, **Show Code Actions**, with a default keyboard shortcut of `Ctrl+.`. This command will show the applicable Code Actions at the current cursor position:

![Code Action Invoke Menu](~/content/assets/images/code-action-invoke-menu.png)

You can also find the applicable Code Actions through the **Refactor** submenu of the right-click context menu:

![Code Action Refactor Submenu](~/content/assets/images/code-action-refactor-submenu.png)

Lastly, a lightbulb or screwdriver icon is shown in the editor's left margin when the cursor is placed on a code segment with applicable actions. Clicking on the icon will also bring up the Code Actions menu:

![Code Actions Margin](~/content/assets/images/code-action-margin.png)

When you hover the mouse cursor over an action in the Code Actions menu, a tooltip will show more information about the action. Click the "Learn more" link, to view the knowledge-base (KB) article for the action.

## Code Action indicators

**Improvements** and **Readability** Code Actions will also be indicated visually in the code editor. This lets you quickly determine which parts of your code can be improved or made more readable.

- **Improvements** are shown with orange dots under the first few characters of the code segment (unless that code segment already displays an orange warning squiggly). A _lightbulb_ icon will appear in the left margin when the cursor is moved over the code segment.
- **Readability** actions are shown with teal green dots under the first few characters of the code segment. When the cursor is moved over the code segment, a _screwdriver_ icon will appear in the left margin.
- **Rewrites** are not visually indicated in the code itself; however, the _screwdriver_ icon will appear in the left margin when the cursor is placed on a code segment with applicable rewrites.

## Apply to all occurrences

Some Code Actions can be applied to all occurrences within the current DAX expression, DAX script, or DAX query rather than just the code segment under the cursor. When this is the case, the Code Action will be shown in the Code Actions menu with " (All occurrences)" appended to the action description. Clicking on the action will apply the change to all occurrences in the document.

In the screenshot below, for example, the **Prefix variable with '_'** action can be applied to all occurrences (i.e., all variables) in the document, not just the `totalSales` variable under the cursor:

![Code Action All Occurrences](~/content/assets/images/code-action-all-occurrences.png)

## List of Code Actions

The table below lists all currently available Code Actions. You can toggle off Code Actions in the **Tools > Preferences** dialog under **Text Editors > DAX Editor > Code Actions** (a future update will let you toggle individual actions for a more customized experience). Some Code Actions also have additional configuration options, such as which prefix to use for variable names.

### Improvements

The Code Actions below will appear with orange dots under the first two characters of the applicable code and a lightbulb icon in the left margin when the cursor is placed on the code segment:

| ID    | Name                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Example:<br>`VAR a = 1 VAR b = a RETURN 123` -> `123`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| DI003 | [Remove table name](xref:DI003)                               | Measure references should not include the table name, as the table name is unnecessary when referencing measures. Moreover, this practice makes measure references more easily distinguishable from column references. Example:<br>`Sales[Total Sales]` -> `[Total Sales]`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DI004 | [Add table name](xref:DI004)                                  | Column references should include the table name to avoid ambiguities and to more easily distinguish column references from measure references. Example:<br>`SUM([SalesAmount])` -> `SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| DI005 | [Rewrite table filter as scalar predicate](xref:DI005)        | A common anti-pattern in DAX is to filter a table inside a [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/CALCULATE) filter argument when it is sufficient to filter one or more columns from that table. Example:<br>`CALCULATE([Total Sales], FILTER(Products, Products[Color] = "Red"))` -> `CALCULATE([Total Sales], KEEPFILTERS(Products[Color] = "Red"))`<br>This Code Action supports various variations of the original expression.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| DI006 | [Split multi-column filter into multiple filters](xref:DI006) | When filtering a table on multiple columns combined using `AND` (or the equivalent `&&` operator), better performance can often be achieved by specifying multiple filters, one for each column. Example:<br>`CALCULATE(..., Products[Color] = "Red" && Products[Size] = "Large")` -> `CALCULATE(..., Products[Color] = "Red", Products[Size] = "Large")`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| DI007 | [Simplify SWITCH statement](xref:DI007)                       | A [`SWITCH`](https://dax.guide/SWITCH) statement that specifies `TRUE()` for the **&lt;Expression&gt;** argument, and where all **&lt;Value&gt;** arguments are simple comparisons of the same variable/measure, can be simplified. Example:<br>`SWITCH(TRUE(), a = 1, ..., a = 2, ...)` -> `SWITCH(a, 1, ..., 2, ...)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| DI008 | [Remove superfluous CALCULATE](xref:DI008)                    | A [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/CALCULATE) function that is not necessary because it does not modify the filter context, or because an implicit context transition would happen anyway, should be removed. Examples:<br>`CALCULATE([Total Sales])` -> `[Total Sales]`<br>`AVERAGEX(Product, CALCULATE([Total Sales]))` -> `AVERAGEX(Product, [Total Sales])`<br><br>Also applies when the first argument of `CALCULATE` / `CALCULATETABLE` is a DAX variable, e.g.:<br>`VAR x = [Total Sales] RETURN CALCULATE(x, Product[Color] = "Red")` -><br>`VAR x = [Total Sales] RETURN x` |
| DI009 | [Avoid calculate shortcut syntax](xref:DI009)                 | Example:<br>`[Total Sales](Products[Color] = "Red")` -> `CALCULATE([Total Sales], Products[Color] = "Red")`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| DI010 | [Use MIN/MAX instead of IF](xref:DI010)                       | When a conditional expression is used to return the minimum or maximum of two values, it is more efficient and compact to use the [`MIN`](https://dax.guide/MIN) or [`MAX`](https://dax.guide/MAX) function. Example:<br>`IF(a > b, a, b)` -> `MAX(a, b)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| DI011 | [Use ISEMPTY instead of COUNTROWS](xref:DI011)                | When checking if a table is empty, it is more efficient to use the [`ISEMPTY`](https://dax.guide/ISEMPTY) function than to count the rows of the table.

| DI012 | [Use DIVIDE instead of division](xref:DI012)                  | When using an arbitrary expression in the denominator of a division, use [`DIVIDE`](https://dax.guide/DIVIDE) instead of the division operator to avoid division by zero errors. Example:<br>`x / y` -> `DIVIDE(x, y)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| ID    | Name                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| RW001 | [Rewrite TOTALxTD using CALCULATE](xref:RW001) | Functions such as [`TOTALMTD`](https://dax.guide/TOTALMTD), [`TOTALQTD`](https://dax.guide/TOTALQTD) and [`TOTALYTD`](https://dax.guide/TOTALYTD) can be rewritten using the [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/CALCULATE) function, which is more expressive and provides greater flexibility. Example:<br>`TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])` -> `CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESYTD('Date'[Date]))` |
| RW002 | [Rewrite using FILTER](xref:RW002)             | A scalar predicate in a filter argument to `CALCULATE` can be rewritten using `FILTER`. This is useful, for example, when you need to add more complex filtering logic. Example:<br>`CALCULATE(..., Products[Color] = "Red")` -> `CALCULATE(..., FILTER(ALL(Products[Color]), Products[Color] = "Red"))`                                                                               |
| RW003 | [Invert IF](xref:RW003)                        | To improve readability, it is sometimes useful to invert `IF` statements. Example:<br>`IF(a < b, "B is greater", "A is greater")` -> `IF(a > b, "A is greater", "B is greater")`                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Customizing Code Actions

You can customize the behavior of Code Actions through the **Tools > Preferences** dialog under **Text Editors > DAX Editor > Code Actions**. Here, you can toggle the feature on and off and configure additional options for some Code Actions, such as the prefix to use for variable names and extension columns.

We plan to add more configuration options to this screen in future versions, such as an option to toggle individual Code Actions on and off. Stay tuned!
