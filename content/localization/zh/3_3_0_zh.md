_If you haven't used Tabular Editor 3 before, you are eligible to a 30 day trial, which can be requested after installation. You can also [purchase a license](https://tabulareditor.com/licensing)._

## Important!

Tabular Editor 3 is now using [.NET 6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6) (we've been using .NET Framework 4.8.2 until now). With .NET 6, Microsoft has provided a unified and modern application development platform, which includes multiple performance improvements and security updates. As a Tabular Editor 3 user, you shouldn't notice any differences other than a slightly increased download size and possible performance improvements.

**NOTE**: You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0. Make sure to grab the **Desktop** runtime that matches your version of Tabular Editor 3:

- [.NET Desktop Runtime x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.6-windows-x64-installer)
- [.NET Desktop Runtime x86](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.6-windows-x86-installer)

## Improvements in 3.3.0

- Updated TOM to [19.39.2.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64/)
- Tabular Editor 3 now uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) for C# script compilation. This means that your C# scripts can now use all the wonderful new language features of [C# 10.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10). Moreover, you can define classes and other types directly within your scripts. Last but not least, we finally have Roslyn-powered **code completion** and **calltips** for C# scripts (see screenshot).

- On a similar note, make sure to check out our new [Scripting API](xref:api-index) docs site, where you'll find up-to-date documentation for all of the objects and members you can access through Tabular Editor 3's C# scripting feature.
- We also have a great improvement for the auto complete feature in our DAX editors, which will now show tooltips providing more information about the objects in the auto complete list. The tooltip will show the `Description` of measures, columns, etc. If no description is specified, we'll show the first 10 lines of DAX code on the object:

- When opening a model from Analysis Services or the Power BI XMLA endpoint, we now provide options to help you avoid making changes to the model by mistake, which is useful when you have multiple instances of Tabular Editor 3 open. The **Mode** dropdown (see screenshot below) lets you open a model in read-only or read/refresh-only mode. The **Status bar color** dropdown lets you set a color for Tabular Editor 3's status bar, so you can easily distinguish for example production, test, and dev models that are simultaneously open in different instances of Tabular Editor. See [#558](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/558).
  ![New Open Fromdb Options](~/content/assets/images/new-open-fromdb-options.png)
- We have finally added the "Duplicate object" context menu option (Ctrl+D) in the TOM Explorer, see [#501](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/501).
- Added support for Snowflake OAuth and ExternalBrowser authentication, see [#546](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/546).
- Property grid now has a search bar.
- Added more proxy configuration options under **Tools** > **Preferences** > **Proxy Settings**.
- Updated SQL Native Client library to the latest version. Connections to SQL Server now require encryption by default (unless connecting to localhost).
- Added a **Refresh clear** option at the model, table and partition levels, see [#511](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/511).
- Added checkbox to open data models without workspace database, [#523](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/523).
