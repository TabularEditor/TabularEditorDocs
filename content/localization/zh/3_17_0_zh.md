## New in 3.17.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2024/08/14/tabular-editor-3-august-2024-release) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

- We're excited to let you know, that Tabular Editor 3 is now available for [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8/overview). We will continue to support .NET 6 until the end of 2024, however we recommend switching to the .NET 8 version as soon as possible. In our testing, the .NET 8 version starts up ~20% faster, while also consuming less memory.
- The portable builds of Tabular Editor 3 now include the relevant .NET runtime, so you no longer need to install the .NET 6/8 Windows Desktop runtime separately.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET 6 will be going [out-of-support in November 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). If you are not able to install the [.NET 8 Desktop runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) now, please contact your IT organization to plan ahead, as we will no longer be providing .NET 6 builds of Tabular Editor 3 after December 2024. Alternatively, use our portable builds, which include the required .NET runtime.

## Improvements in 3.17.0

- DAX query results and table previews now show the "long time format" for datetime values, rather than "short time". This way, seconds are also shown in the result grid.
- Shared expressions can now be excluded from being deployed using the Deployment Wizard. This enhancement allows you to retain existing shared expressions on the destination server as-is, when deploying a model, even if shared expressions were created/deleted/modified in the model being deployed.
- The DAX debugger **Locals** window now lets you "inspect" results, similar to the **Watch** window. By default, inspector results are shown in a popup dialog rather than as a new DAX Query, but you can control this behavior under **Tools > Preferences > DAX Debugger**. Click the magnifying glass icon next to the value in the **Locals** or **Watch** view to inspect the value. See the updated [DAX Debugger documentation](xref:dax-debugger#locals) for more information.
- When debugging a scalar predicate in a filter argument of [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/calculate) or [`CALCULATETABLE`](https://dax.guide/calculatetable), the **Locals** view now shows additional details about the scalar predicate and the resulting filter expression. See the updated [DAX Debugger documentation](xref:dax-debugger#scalar-predicates) for more information.
- DAX scripts can now be applied when the script contains semantic errors. A warning will be shown if there are any semantic errors to make the end user aware if they want to proceed with the current errors or cancel and fix the semantic errors. Syntax errors, on the other hand, will still prevent the script from being applied.
- Added auto-complete support for a few more DAX `INFO.*` functions.
- The DAX Optimizer Integration (Preview) feature now lets you switch between personal or group accounts in group licensing scenarios. You can choose which account you want to use, through the **Options** dropdow menu. See also [#1288](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1288). Moreover, you can now change the _Fixed_ or _Ignored_ status of an issue directly from the DAX Optimizer Results view.
- The Table Import Wizard and Update Table Schema feature now supports **Databricks Multicloud**, in addition to **Azure Databricks**. For more information, see the discussion on [#1347](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/discussions/1347).
- The Preferences for the VertiPaq Analyzer were expanded to configure the column batch size. This preference controls the number of columns processed at a time during column statistics analysis and it can be found under **Tools > Preferences > VertiPaq Analyzer**. The default value for this preference is 50.
- Custom formatting applied to Pivot Grids (icons, data bars, highlighted cells, etc.) is now preserved when the Pivot Grid layout is saved to a file and later reloaded.
- Pivot Grids now also preserve any sorting applied to fields when the grid is refreshed or when the grid layout is saved to a file and later reloaded.

## Bugfixes in 3.17.0

- Fixed an bug introduced in 3.16.0, which caused an application freeze for several seconds after loading a diagram file (.te3diag)
- Fixed an issue that prevented saving the options in the "Find/Replace" dialog box between sessions, when using the "Find all" button. Now, the last search preferences will be retained in the next session.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the deployment of deletions for data sources, roles, and role members to an existing model. Previously, the corresponding checkboxes in the Deployment Wizard were disabled when there were no data sources or roles in the model. Now, these checkboxes remain enabled when deploying changes to an existing model, allowing for the deployment of these object's deletions.
- Fixed an issue that prevented files with the .ovpax extension from opening as a file or model. The possibility to open .ovpax files and models is now supported.
- Fixed a bug where the wrong file type might have been suggested by the file dialog window when exporting obfuscated files from the VertiPaq Analyzer. Now, when exporting an obfuscated file, the save dialog will correctly suggest using the ".ovpax" extension.
- Fixed a bug where toolbar buttons would stay disabled when the Expression Editor was docked as a tool window rather than as a document tab.
- Fixed a bug that prevented opening semantic models saved as ".tmdl" with [Power BI Project files (PBIP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-overview).
- Fixed a bug that caused the application to hang during manual activation.
- Macro recorder should no longer generate duplicate code. Moreover, the recorder should now also generate code when objects are deleted.
- **Auto formatting** settings for **DAX Editors**, including DAX Query, DAX Script, and DAX expressions in the Expression Editor, are now applied instantly, without the need to restart the application.
- Fixed an issue where unchecking the **Encrypt connection** option did not disable encryption in the connection string for Microsoft SQL Server data sources.
- Fixed a bug where ODBC username and password were not added to the connection string when importing tables or updating table schema. This issue would prevent users from importing tables or updating table schema when using ODBC connections against some data sources, such as Snowflake or Oracle.
- Fixed a bug where it was not possible to list the ODBC DSNs when importing tables, if no User DSNs were present on the machine.
- When querying schema information from an ODBC source, we now use various fallbacks, which should improve compatibility with more ODBC drivers, such as the Oracle in OraClient12Home1 driver.
- Fixed a bug where data sources referenced in M queries would appear as implicit data sources in the Import Table Wizard.
- Fixed a bug where some Pivot Grid toolbar buttons would remain disabled, after a Pivot Grid was reloaded from a file.
- Fixed a bug where constants in M expressions (such as `Order.Ascending`) would result in an **Unknown identifier** error, when using the **Update Table Schema** feature. See [#1362](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1362).
- When using the DAX `DIVIDE` function with a non-numeric 3rd argument, the DAX parser now correctly determines the resulting data type to be Variant.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Tabular Editor from loading model metadata from a TMDL folder with no database.tmdl file.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft has announced that [TMDL is in GA](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-tabular-model-definition-language-tmdl/) as of August 2nd, 2024. Please note that Tabular Editor 3 is using a version of the [AMO/TOM client library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64/19.79.1.1), which was released before TMDL was announced as GA. This version should still be fully compatible with TMDL, however, we recommend keeping a backup of your TMSL (.bim) files, just in case.
