### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3 uses .NET 6. If you're using the portable version, you may have to manually install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.

## New in 3.15.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2024/04/24/tabular-editor-3-april-2024-release/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

- We have a new **Preview** feature this month: **DAX Optimizer integration**. If you have a DAX Optimizer account, you can connect to your workspaces, upload VPAX files, and view [DAX Optimizer](https://daxoptimizer.com) results directly in Tabular Editor. [More information](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/te3/features/dax-optimizer-integration).
- We now support adding [Data Coverage Definition expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tom/table-partitions?view=asallproducts-allversions#define-the-data-coverage-of-the-directquery-partition) to partitions in DirectQuery mode.
- Tabular Editor will now add a `__TEdtr` annotation to your model when metadata is saved to disk (either as Model.bim, Database.json or TMDL). This annotation is used by Microsoft for analytics about Tabular Editor usage for semantic models published to a Power BI or Fabric workspace. This annotation may also be required for certain features to work correctly in Power BI / Fabric, when a model was edited using Tabular Editor.
- The **New Model** dialog now has a **Direct Lake** checkbox\*, which will configure the model to use the new Direct Lake storage mode in Fabric. [More information](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/common/Datasets/direct-lake-dataset.html). Moreover, you can now explicitly choose the _Compatibility Mode_ when entering the _Compatibility Level_ manually.
- You can now export [obfuscated VPAX files](https://www.sqlbi.com/blog/marco/2024/03/15/vpax-obfuscator-a-library-to-obfuscate-vpax-files/) using Tabular Editor. This can be helpful when your metadata (object names and DAX expressions) are confidential, but you want to share the VPAX file with a person or service for optimization purposes. Find this option in the **VertiPaq Analyzer** view, on the dropdown next to the **Export** button.

## Improvements in 3.15.0

- We've updated [AMO/TOM to 19.79.1.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64). In this update, a bug that could sometimes cause overlapping policy range partitions to be generated, when invoking the "Apply Refresh Policy" option, has been fixed.
- Default _Compatibility Level_ for new Power BI / Fabric models set to 1605.
- When a Direct Lake model is initially deployed, we now perform an automatic refresh, which is a prerequisite to avoid DirectQuery fallback. Moreover, there is a new option (which is enabled by default), to also perform an automatic refresh whenever a Direct Lake model is saved, when new tables have been added. This preference is located under **Tools > Preferences > Model Deployment > Data Refresh**.
- Add new sorting option when scripting DAX items: when enabling "Sort scripted items alphabetically", all DAX items in the script will be sorted alphabetically by name.
- Add six new editor commands and default keyboard shortcuts to interact with foldable code regions in DAX editors:
  - `Editor.Dax.CollapseAllFolds`: collapse/close all foldable regions in the document. Default shortcut: **Ctrl+Alt+[**
  - `Editor.Dax.ExpandAllFolds`: expand/open all foldable regions in the document. Default shortcut: **Ctrl+Alt+]**
  - `Editor.Dax.ToggleAllFolds`: toggle the state of all foldable regions between expanded and collapsed; this ensures that all folds end up in the same state. Default shortcut: **Ctrl+Alt+;**
  - `Editor.Dax.CollapseFold`: collapse/close the foldable region that the cursor is currently positioned in. Default shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+[**
  - `Editor.Dax.ExpandFold`: expand/open the foldable region that the cursor is currently positioned in. Default shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+]**
  - `Editor.Dax.ToggleFold`: toggle the state of the foldable region that the cursor is in between the open and close states. Default shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+;**
- The DAX editor now lets you delete individual words inside table/column/measure references when using **Ctrl+Backspace** or **Ctrl+Delete**. To delete the full reference, place the cursor at the beginning or end of the reference and use the same shortcuts.
- "database.tmdl" files are now also shown in the **Open Model from File** dialog, in addition to "model.tmdl" files. It doesn't matter which file is opened - Tabular Editor loads the full model metadata from both files in any case.
- When collecting VertiPaq Analyzer statistics for a Direct Lake model, only resident columns are queried by default. This considerable reduces the time it takes to collect statistics for large models. You can still choose to include non-resident columns by changing the **Statistics for Direct Lake models** setting under **Tools > Preferences > VertiPaq Analyzer**.
- Add preferences to control Currency formatting under **'Tools' > 'Preferences' > 'TOM Explorer' > 'Localization'**: previously, currency was hard coded to use a US Dollar symbol ($) at the beginning of the format string. Now, you can select either a standard formatting style from a searchable dropdown, or define your own custom symbol and positioning.

## Bugfixes in 3.15.0

- Fixed an issue where customized keyboard shortcuts for "Editor.Dax.FormatLong" and "Editor.Dax.FormatShort" didn't work.
- Fixed a bug where macros would not be fully loaded, unless the macro definitions in the MacroActions.json file were ordered by macro ID, see [#1151](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1151).
- If a table preview fails in the Import Table Wizard, it should now be possible to continue previewing other tables.
- Table previews in the Import Table Wizard, should now work correctly for Fabric Lakehouse SQL endpoints.
- When saving a model as TMDL, the default encoding is now UTF8 without Byte-Order-Marks (BOM), which should be compatible with Power BI Desktop.
- Fixed a bug where URL tooltips on the **What's New** page would linger on the screen.
- The built-in DAX formatter should no longer replace KPI references with their base measure reference.
- Fixed a bug where the "Ignore incremental refresh partitions" and "Ignore lineage tags" serialization settings were not being properly saved.

\*=Direct Lake models require Fabric workspaces. As such, they are only accessible for Tabular Editor 3 Enterprise Edition customers.
