> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are no longer providing .NET 6 builds of Tabular Editor 3, as this is [out-of-support as of November 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). If you are not able to install the [.NET 8 Desktop runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime), please contact your IT organization. Alternatively, use our portable builds, which include the required .NET runtime.

## New in 3.22.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

(**Enterprise Edition only**) Tabular Editor 3 now fully supports Direct Lake over OneLake and Direct Lake over SQL. This means:

- The Table Import Wizard has new import options for Fabric Warehouses and Lakehouses. You no longer need to know the SQL analytics endpoint of the Warehouse/Lakehouse you wish to connect to. Instead, we show you a list of all the Warehouses/Lakehouses in your workspace, allowing you to choose the one you wish to use.
- On the last page of the Table Import Wizard, you can choose whether to use Direct Lake in OneLake or SQL mode, or whether to configure the table for plain old "import" mode.
- When the model contains tables in Direct Lake over OneLake mode, you can now also add tables in Import mode, in order to create mixed mode/hybrid models.
- When previewing data in Direct Lake tables, we no longer restrict the number of rows returned (so you can freely scroll through all the data in the table, just like in Import mode). Be aware that all columns are swapped into the Semantic Model in the Fabric capacity when you perform a data preview. Consider using a DAX Query if you are concerned about memory consumption on your Fabric capacity.

> [!NOTE]
> We no longer configure Direct Lake models to use a case _sensitive_ collation. If you plan to use Direct Lake over SQL with a Fabric Warehouse that uses a case sensitive collation, you must manually fill out the **Collation** property of your semantic model _before_ adding any tables or other objects.

## Improvements in 3.22.0

- When saving a model as a single file, the **Save file** dialog now suggests "model.bim" as the default file name.
- Updated various dependencies to their latest versions, including [AMO/TOM to 19.98.0.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices/). This update fixes longstanding authentication issues with Work or School accounts and repeated sign in promts.
- DAX query editor support for the [`MPARAMETER`](https://dax.guide/st/mparameter/) keyword, see [#1467](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1467).
- Our DAX editors now support **word based** auto complete search terms. In other words, if you type `sales ytd` in the editor, the auto complete will now suggest measures such as `[Sales Margin YTD]`, `[Sales Revenue YTD]`, etc.
- With the June 2025 update of Power BI Desktop, [external tools can now perform any write operation on the semantic model](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-june-2025-feature-summary/#post-30307-_Toc269410729). As such, we no longer restrict the modeling operations available in Tabular Editor, when connecting to a model in this or newer versions of Power BI Desktop.

## Bugfixes in 3.22.1

- Fixed a bug where the **Data Refresh** view would turn blank and not show additional refresh operations until the app was restarted. See [#1461](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1461).

## Bugfixes in 3.22.0

- Added exception handling when encountering IOException's during save-to-folder operations (where we sometimes need to delete folders in the folder structure, which can be blocked by file system locks placed by version control systems).
- Fixed a bug where certain keyboard shortcuts (both default and customized) didn't work when the "What's new" page was focused.
- When assigning a custom keyboard shortcut that is already assigned to another command, we now show a warning message and remove the shortcut from the other command, to avoid ambiguity.
- Fixed a bug where the Semantic Analyzer showed a false error message when using unqualified column references in a DAX window function. See [#1460](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1460).
- Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause the **Data Refresh** view to freeze, requiring an app restart to resolve. See [#1461](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1461).
- Fixed several smaller DAX editor issues related to auto complete, auto formatting, and syntax highlighting of keywords.
- Query Group names (i.e. "display folders" for Shared M expressions and M partitions) can now be modified. Also, if pasting an object with a query group into a model that doesn't contain said query group, it will be created automatically, so as to avoid the error message on subsequent Save / Deployment of the model.
- Fixed a bug where it was sometimes not possible to Undo previous changes, after saving the model metadata back to the server.
