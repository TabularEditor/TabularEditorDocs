## Improvements in 3.1.5

- You can now **impersonate** users or roles on DAX queries, Pivot Grids and Table Previews. This is useful for testing RLS and OLS settings. [More information](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/onboarding/refresh-preview-query.html#impersonation).
- DAX scripts now support calculation groups and calculation items. This allows you to view all calculation group logic (including format string expressions) in a single document. [Example](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/onboarding/dax-script-introduction.html#example-3-calculation-group).
- When right-clicking on a measure reference in a DAX query or DAX script, there is now an option to add the definition of that measure [including all dependencies](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/onboarding/dax-script-introduction.html#define-measures).
- You can now pan diagrams by dragging an empty area (see [#275](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/275)).

## Bugfixes in 3.1.5

- Fixed issue with the built-in schema updater when a `null` value is encountered in an M expression (see [#282](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/282)).
- Semantic analyzer no longer reports an error when using the `RELATED` function in an argument to `SELECTCOLUMNS`(when no name argument is specified).
- Macros can now be edited/renamed without disappearing from toolbar customizations (see [#266](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/266)).
- All custom toolbars can now be renamed/deleted after restarting the application (see [#260](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/260)).
- Fixed selection/context menu when selecting a folder of folders (see [#248](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/248)).
- Prevented crash when simultaneously selecting tables/table objects.
- Fixed various issues/crashes when importing tables (ODBC NullReferenceException, and more).
