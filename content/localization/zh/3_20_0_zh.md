> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET 6 is [out-of-support as of November 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). If you are not able to install the [.NET 8 Desktop runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) now, please contact your IT organization, as we will stop providing .NET 6 builds of Tabular Editor 3 during 2025. Alternatively, use our portable builds, which include the required .NET runtime.

## New in 3.20.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2025/02/21/tabular-editor-3-february-2025-release/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

## Improvements in 3.20.0

- All [code actions](xref:code-actions) now show a tooltip in the context menu when hovering over the menu item, with a short description of the action. The tooltip also contains a link to a knowledge-base (KB) article with more information about the action.
- We've also added a few new code actions in this release, based on popular demand. For example, we will now suggest that you use the `IN` operator instead of using a compound expression with `OR` / `||`. View the [full list of available code actions here](xref:code-actions#list-of-code-actions).
- Introduced a new user interface preference labeled "Use compact file paths" to toggle between displaying compact (shortened) file paths and full file paths in the Recent Files and Recent Models menus.
- When editing a model that's loaded in Power BI Desktop (January 2025 or newer), Tabular Editor will now let you edit any object and property by default, except tables and partitions, in alignment with the modeling operations supported by the new [TMDL View](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-tmdl-view) in Power BI Desktop.
- When changing the DAX expression of a calculated table, Tabular Editor 3 will now attempt to infer the resulting columns of the table, even if the expression has an error.
- A new DAX Query preference labeled "Keep existing sorting and filtering in the result grid" has been added to the DAX Query menus and toolbar, allowing users to control how sorting and filtering are preserved in the result grids between query executions.
- We've made several improvements to our **Diagram View**. Most importantly, it now renders much faster, especially when many tables/relationships are present. But there are also several visual tweaks.
- We've improved the C# auto-complete feature, so that it now shows only items that are relevant for the current target. For example, if you type `Selected.Column.DataType = `, the listbox will now only show the valid [`DataType` enum values](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.datatype?view=analysisservices-dotnet#fields). Moreover, if the same type exists in different namespaces, we now show the namespace in a parenthesis, to disambiguate the items in the list.
- Updated AMO/TOM to the latest version [19.88.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices/).
- We have added auto-complete support to the new DAX scalar inspection functions, [`ISINT64`](https://dax.guide/isint64), [`ISBOOLEAN`](https://dax.guide/isboolean), [`ISDOUBLE`](https://dax.guide/isboolean), [`ISDECIMAL`](https://dax.guide/isdecimal), [`ISDATETIME`](https://dax.guide/isdatetime), [`ISSTRING`](https://dax.guide/isstring), and [`ISNUMERIC`](https://dax.guide/isnumeric).

## Bugfixes in 3.20.0

- The **Rewrite using ISBLANK** DAX Code Action will no longer trigger when using non-strict equality comparisons, e.g. `x = BLANK()`, as this is semantically different from `ISBLANK(x)`.
- Various bugfixes for unhandled exceptions in the DAX Editor.
- The Semantic Analyzer now correctly shows an error message if using a group-by column within a call to [`SUMMARIZE`](https://dax.guide/summarize), which has no relation to the base table.
- When creating VPAX files through the **DAX Optimizer** view, we will now use the **Full** extraction mode for Direct Lake models, producing a VPAX file that is valid for DAX Optimizer analysis.
- Various Pivot Grid bugfixes and stability improvements.
- Fixed a bug where unassigning/resetting an Editor shortcut, would not be effective until restarting the application.
- Fixed a bug where certain editor shortcuts (such as "Duplicate Line (Ctrl+D)") would trigger an action in the TOM Explorer with the same key binding, even when the editor was focused.
- Fixed a bug where adding a level to a hierarchy in a Power BI Desktop model, would not include the column reference, causing an error when attempting to save the change.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when executing a DAX script containing certain syntax or errors.
- Creating and editing DAX scripts should no longer cause the UI to lock up, which could happen when the script contained syntax or semantic errors.
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the **Data Refresh** view to lock up/crash while a refresh was in progress.
- Fixed a bug causing a crash when loading a model and then navigating to a partition with a [Data Coverage Definition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tom/table-partitions?view=asallproducts-allversions#define-the-data-coverage-of-the-directquery-partition).
- The auto-complete feature of C# scripts should now work correctly when making multiple insertions in the script, such as in [#1327](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1327).
- Hitting F12 (Go to Definition) on a measure format string expression reference, will now correctly navigate to the referenced measure's format string expression property, rather than the base expression property.
- Fixed an issue with our Semantic Analyzer, that didn't correctly detect when a relationship was activated by the [`USERELATIONSHIP`](https://dax.guide/userelationship) function.
- Fixed an issue with false circular dependency errors appearing while editing the DAX of calculated columns.
- Fixed a bug that prevented **TE3 Business Edition** license holders to connect to Power BI Premium-Per-User (PPU) workspaces, in some regions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to technical limitations, previous versions of TE3 might sometimes allow **Business Edition** license holders to connect to Power BI Premium / Fabric Capacity workspaces, even though [this is not allowed per the Business Edition license terms](xref:editions). If you are facing issues connecting to the Power BI XMLA endpoint after upgrading to 3.20.0, please reach out to [licensing@tabulareditor.com](mailto:licensing@tabulareditor.com) so we can assist you in finding a suitable solution going forward.

## Known issues in 3.20.0

- The Semantic Analyzer doesn't correctly detect relationship activations with `USERELATIONSHIP` when there are only inactive relationships between two tables.
- The Semantic Analyzer doesn't always infer the correct data type for the column returned by the [`GENERATESERIES`](https://dax.guide/generateseries) function.
- The new **Diagram view** does not correctly indicate bi-directional relationships.
