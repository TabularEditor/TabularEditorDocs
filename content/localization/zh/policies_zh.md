# Policies

Some IT organisations may wish to limit certain features of Tabular Editor. This is possible through the use of group policies, by setting certain values in the Windows registry.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality requires the following versions of Tabular Editor:
>
> - Tabular Editor 2 version [2.17.0](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/releases/tag/2.17.0) or newer
> - Tabular Editor 3 version [3.3.5](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/releases/tag/3.3.5) or newer.

Below is a listing of the policies that can be controlled. To enforce one or more of these policies, add a non-zero DWORD value to the registry key. The name of the value specifies which policy to enforce.

**Registry key:** HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Kapacity\Tabular Editor\

| Value                          | When enforced...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Disabling custom scripts

If you want to ensure that Tabular Editor does not allow users to execute arbitrary code, specify the `DisableCSharpScripts` and `DisableMacros` policies.
