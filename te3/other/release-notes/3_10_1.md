### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Bugfixes in 3.10.1

- Fixed a bug that caused a crash whenever the user attempted to type a DAX expression in the DAX Debugger's Watch Expression window.

## New in 3.10.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/08/23/tabular-editor-3-august-2023-release/) to get an overview of the most important updates in this release.

- Tabular Editor now supports adding tables to [Direct Lake datasets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/directlake-overview) through the Import Table Wizard. Moreover, you can update the schema of existing tables the usual way. Tabular Editor utilises the [SQL endpoint of your Fabric Lakehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-sql-endpoint) to obtain the table schemas. We've also published a [blog post on DirectLake, if you want to learn more](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/08/23/fabric-direct-lake-dataset/).

> [!NOTE]
> This version of Tabular Editor will let you import tables / update table schemas on models that already have a Direct Lake connection. The Import Table Wizard does not yet support creating a new Direct Lake connection on an empty model. This will be added in a future release.

> [!WARNING]
> Once you make any changes to a Direct Lake dataset through the XMLA endpoint, you will [no longer be able to open that dataset in the Web Modelling feature of Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/directlake-overview#enable-xmla-read-write:~:text=Direct%20Lake%20datasets%20created%20or%20modified%20by%20using%20XMLA%2Dbased%20tools%20cannot%20be%20opened%20in%20the%20Web%20modelling%20feature.).

- C# scripts now support [preprocessor directives](xref:csharp-scripts#compatibility) to determine which version of Tabular Editor you're using. This allows you to write scripts that are compatible with both Tabular Editor 2 and Tabular Editor 3.

## Improvements in 3.10.0

- We're now using using the latest version of [AMO/TOM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64/). This update adds support for Binary XML, which should help speed up XMLA operations. More details in this [Microsoft blog post](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/improving-the-communication-performance-of-xmla-based-tools/).
- We also updated [TMDL to preview-3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Tabular.Tmdl.NetCore.retail.amd64/19.65.12.3-TmdlPreview), which includes a number of bugfixes.

> [!NOTE]
> TMDL is still in preview, and as such, this feature must also be considered a preview feature of Tabular Editor 3. Make sure to keep a Model.bim / Database.json backup of your model metadata to avoid losing work.

- When cloning objects, we now add the suffix "-Copy" instead of " Copy", to reduce the risk of leaving trailing blanks in object names, see [#940](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/940).
- The auto-complete popup now automatically adjusts its width to fit the widest item inside of it. See [#965](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/965).
- When a backup .bim file is saved for a Power BI Desktop model, we now use the name of the .pbix file, instead of the database GUID, see [#958](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/958).
- Table Preview performance improvements.

## Bugfixes in 3.10.0

- Fixed a bug that prevented Synonyms (linguistic metadata) to be persisted, when using Save to Folder.
- Fixed a bug where the backup .bim file had an incorrect timstamp, see [#967](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/967).
- Fixed a bug that prevented the user from cancelling the deployment when the backup save fails for any reason.
- Find Panel on Table Preview should now generate valid DAX search expressions behind the scenes, see [#955](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/955).
- Fixed an issue that caused the "Go to definition (F12)" action to be disabled when the caret was placed on a DAX function, see [#962](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/962).
- Fixed a bug that prevented loading models from .vpax files in some cases.
- The height of the "result count" panel in DAX queries should now automatically adjust to fit its content.
- The Properties grid now correctly displays multi-line expressions that happen to start with one or more line breaks, just like when editing the expression inside the grid.
- Fixed a bug that could cause Pivot Grid to get stuck in an infinite error-message loop, when columns that were added to the Pivot Grid were deleted from the remote model.
- Fixed a bug where macros added to the menu bar, would stop working after a restart of Tabular Editor.
- Fixed a bug where attempting to perform a Schema Update on multiple tables originating from the same source table, would fail for all except one.
