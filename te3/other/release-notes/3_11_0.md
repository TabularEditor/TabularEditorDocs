### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New in 3.11.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/09/25/september-release-tabular-editor-3-11-0/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

- As noted in [last months' release notes](xref:release-3-10-1), Tabular Editor did not let you create a [Direct Lake dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/directlake-overview) from scratch. This is now possible! The only prerequisite is that the model does not already have any tables or explicit data sources defined, and that its Compatibility Mode is set to PowerBI. Check out our [blog post on DirectLake, if you want to learn more](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/08/23/fabric-direct-lake-dataset/).

> [!WARNING]
> Once you make any changes to a Direct Lake dataset through the XMLA endpoint, you will [no longer be able to open that dataset in the Web Modelling feature of Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/directlake-overview#enable-xmla-read-write:~:text=Direct%20Lake%20datasets%20created%20or%20modified%20by%20using%20XMLA%2Dbased%20tools%20cannot%20be%20opened%20in%20the%20Web%20modelling%20feature.).

## Improvements in 3.11.0

- We're now using using the latest version of [AMO/TOM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64/) and [TMDL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Tabular.Tmdl.NetCore.retail.amd64), which includes a number of bugfixes and stability improvements.

> [!NOTE]
> TMDL is still in preview, and as such, this feature must also be considered a preview feature of Tabular Editor 3. Make sure to keep a Model.bim / Database.json backup of your model metadata to avoid losing work.

- Our DAX parser and autocomplete now supports the newly added 3rd parameter to [`MINX`](https://dax.guide/minx)/[`MAXX`](https://dax.guide/maxx). Moreover, we now also provide suggestions for the [`MATCHBY`](https://dax.guide/matchby) function, which can be used as an optional parameter of window functions.
- The Native Query option of the Table Import Wizard is now available when importing from Databricks, provided a catalog has been specified.

## Bugfixes in 3.11.0

- The list of reserved table names in DAX has been updated using the `$system.discover_keywords` DMV. The consequence is that our built-in DAX formatter now correctly applies quotes on certain table names, which are also reserved words. For example, a reference to a table named `status` will now always be quoted. See [#991](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/991).
- Autocomplete now suggests proper keywords for the *&lt;Skip&gt;* parameter of DAX window functions such as [`RANK`](https://dax.guide), etc.
- Batch Rename now works for folders, see [#797](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/797).
- Fixed some issues regarding custom layouts, see [#711](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/711). Also fixed an issue where customizations to the built-in menus, were not properly persisted.
- Fixed a bug in the Deployment Wizard, when the model contains an incremental refresh table with no partitions. In this case, the deployment wizard UI did not allow the user to skip partition deployment of this table which would cause an invalid TMSL to be generated generated (one with no partitions for the table in question).
- Fixed a bug, where running a DAX query with no whitespace between [`EVALUATE`](https://dax.guide) and the following expression would cause an error.
- Fixed numerous issues with the DAX debugger. See [#954](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/954), [#971](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/971) and [#984](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/984).
