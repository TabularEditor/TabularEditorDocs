## Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3 uses .NET 6. If you're using the portable version, you may have to manually install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.

## New in 3.16.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

We have substantially overhauled how **Pivot Grids** work in this release. Some highlights include:

  - Pivot Grid layouts can now be saved and loaded to/from files! A new file format, `.te3pivot` is used to store a JSON representation of the Pivot Grid layout.
  - Hidden objects (measures, columns, hierarchies) can now be used in a Pivot Grid, and object renames should no longer cause the Pivot Grid to lose its layout or clear any filters.
  - A new and improved Pivot Grid **Field List**, which is now shown by default, and provides a more familiar experience when adding fields to the Pivot Grid.

  Head on over to the [Pivot Grid documentation](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/te3/features/pivot-grid.html) to learn more about these changes.

## Improvements in 3.16.0

- Reduced the number of redundant error messages that are shown, when DAX expression contain syntax/semantic errors.
- DAX scripts now support unspecified/empty expressions. This allows you to specify a DAX script that does not modify existing expressions on objects, or a script that explicitly sets an expression to be empty.
- You can now export DAX query results to CSV/Excel. Look for the **Export data** and **Export data (all results)** options under the **Query** menu.
- When exporting VertiPaq Analyzer statistics, we now suggest a default name for the VPAX file based on the database name.
- We changed the default keyboard shortcuts for `Editor.Dax.CollapseAllFolds`, `Editor.Dax.ExpandAllFolds` and `Editor.Dax.ToggleAllFolds` from **Ctrl+Alt+(key)** to **Ctrl+Shift+(key)**. This is to avoid conflicts with certain characters that require the **AltGr** key (which is equivalent to **Ctrl+Alt**) to be typed on non-US keyboards. The **Ctrl+Shift+(key)** shortcuts were previously used by `Editor.Dax.CollapseFold`, `Editor.Dax.ExpandFold` and `Editor.Dax.ToggleFold`. Their defaults have been changed to **Ctrl+(key)**.
- Updated [AMO/TOM to 19.80.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64).
- Menus and toolbars are now locked in place by default, preventing accidental repositioning. To unlock them, go to **Tools > Customize... > Options** and uncheck the **Lock menus and toolbars** option.
- Our DAX semantic analyzer now supports the `WITH VISUAL SHAPE` syntax used in DAX queries that contain [visual calculations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview). Note that debugging such queries is not yet supported (as only measures can be debugged, and visual calculations are not measures).
- Show a warning when debugging a Pivot Grid cell value or DAX query that includes calculation items in the filter context (which the TE3 debugger currently doesn't support).

## Bugfixes in 3.16.0

- Pressing control-key combinations that do not have any keybinding assigned, should no longer cause special control chars to be inserted in code editors.
- Macros that have been modified and saved, should no longer execute multiple times when invoked through the UI.
- The `.Output()` method should now show the output dialog on subsequent macro executions, even when the **Don't show more outputs** option was checked on a previous execution.
- Unquoted table name references that also happen to be DAX keywords (such as `Currency`), will no longer be treated as keywords during auto-formatting (i.e. they will not be capitalized). Moreover, certain object properties in DAX scripts can now also be empty. View the updated [DAX Scripts documentation](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/te3/features/dax-scripts.html) for more information.
- Errors during DAX script execution are now handled gracefully, and the changes made by the script before the error was encountered, are automatically rolled back.
- Fixed a bug where macro buttons assigned to custom toolbars did not persist after restarting the application.
- Fixed a bug that would cause Tabular Editor to crash when using the `ForEach<T>(IEnumerable<T>, Action<T>)` extension method in a C# script.
- Fixed bugs regarding removing/resetting shortcut keys, which did not work correctly for some commands.
- Fixed a bug where the Save button would remain disabled after a refresh operation finishes.
- Fixed a bug where certain actions could cause the **TOM Explorer** to lock up and not behave correctly until the application was restarted.
- Fixed a bug where deleting an object in the **TOM Explorer** would cause the selection to jump to the **Model** node, rather than the closest parent node of the deleted object.
- Fixed several bugs related to Pivot Grids.
- The semantic analyzer should no longer produce false errors when comparing against `BLANK()` in expressions such as `"string value" IN { BLANK() }`.
- Fixed a bug where changing serialization settings did not persist when a model was loaded from a TMDL folder. See [#1285](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1285).
- When sorting a column in the Table Preview, where the column has `IsAvailableInMDX = false` (that is, no attribute hierarchies have been created for the column), we will now use `TOPN` queries to preview the data, since `TOPNSKIP` doesn't support sorting by columns with no attribute hierarchies.
