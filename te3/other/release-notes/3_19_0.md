> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET 6 will be going [out-of-support in November 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). If you are not able to install the [.NET 8 Desktop runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) now, please contact your IT organization to plan ahead, as we will no longer be providing .NET 6 builds of Tabular Editor 3 after December 2024. Alternatively, use our portable builds, which include the required .NET runtime.

## New in 3.19.0

This release is all about quality-of-life improvements and bugfixes.

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

- Our DAX code editors now support the **Expand selection** shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+E), which expands the selection to the next logical code block. This is useful, for example, when the cursor is inside a DAX function call, and you want to select the entire function call. Repeatedly pressing Ctrl+Shift+E will expand the selection to the next logical code block, eventually selecting the entire DAX expression.
- We've modified how execution of DAX queries work, due to [popular demand](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/discussions/1359):
  - The **Execute** action (F5) will now execute only the selected portion of the query when text is selected. If no text is selected, the entire query will be executed.
  - **Execute Selection** (Shift+F5) works just like it did before.
  - We've introduced an **Execute full query** action (no default keybinding), in case you need a way to execute the full query without changing your current selection.
  - Last, but certainly not least, you can now *execute partial code*. To do this, simply select a portion of code, such as a table or scalar expression anywhere inside your query (even in comments) and hit F5. Tabular Editor will take care of wrapping scalar expressions in curly braces, wrapping column references in a call to [`DISTINCT`](https://dax.guide/DISTINCT), and adding the `EVALUATE` statement, such that a valid DAX query will be sent to the server.
- Across all of our DAX editors, the vertical scrollbar will now indicate the location of any warnings/errors, as well as applicable [Code Actions](xref:code-actions) in the **Improvements** and **Readability** categories. Mouse over the scrollbar indicator to see a tooltip with a description of the issue, and click to navigate directly to it. This is especially useful when working with large DAX expressions, queries or scripts. If you find this feature distracting, it can be toggled off under **Tools > Preferences > Text Editors > Show indicators on scrollbar**.
- Pin, Unpin, and Delete functionality for the Recent Files and Recent Models menus: Added the ability to pin items to the top of the "Recent Files" and "Recent Models" menus, unpin them, or delete them entirely using a new right-click pop-up menu. Pinned items are visually marked with an icon and prioritized at the top of the menus.

## Improvements in 3.19.0

- We have improved the **Data Refresh** view so progress events that relate to the same table, are now being grouped together. This makes it easier to understand the progress of the refresh operation, especially when refreshing large models with many tables.
- When jumping to a specific section of code outside the current view, we now scroll the editor such that the code in question is shown at the center of the editor, rather than near the top/bottom.
- A new right-click menu action has been added to the DAX query results grid, which will let you show the actual query that was executed (as Tabular Editor may modify the query to add a row limit, or to turn a partial selection into a valid query as mentioned above).
- The "Load Semantic Model from Database" dialog now restores preferences for recently connected servers, including Authentication mode, username (excluding passwords), connection mode, and status bar color.
- Updated AMO/TOM to [19.87.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices/19.87.2).
- Our offline schema detection (based on our M query parser) now fully supports the use of `PowerPlatform.Dataflows`, see [#970](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/970).
- When copying/duplicating tables in the model, the inserted table is typically renamed (to ensure uniqueness of table names in the model). When this happens, we now automatically fix-up DAX expressions of objects within that table. For example, calculated columns or Row-Level Security filter expressions on the table, are now updated to use the name of the inserted table. You can toggle off this behavior under **Tools > Preferences > Modeling operations > Clipboard operations**.

## Bugfixes in 3.19.0

- The **Data Refresh** view will no longer scroll to the top when new progress events are added to the list.
- Data Refresh operations are disabled when connected to a model in Power BI Desktop, as Desktop does not support refresh operations initiated from external tools.
- Fixed an issue with the **Rewrite table filter as scalar predicate** code action not properly qualifying columns with the table name after the rewrite, potentially causing the resulting DAX to be invalid.
- Fixed an issue with the **Split multi-column filter into multiple filters** action, where filters would be deleted, when the original filter contained more than 2 operands.
- When hitting F12 (Go to definition) on an object reference inside a **DAX Script**, the editor will now correctly jump to the object definition inside the script (if it is present), rather than switch to the **Expression Editor**.
- When connected to the Power BI XMLA endpoint or an instance of Azure Analysis Services, attempting to impersonate multiple roles in a Pivot Grid, a Data Preview, or a DAX Query, should now work correctly (instead of only the first role in the list being applied).
- Various bugfixes in the M analyzer, to support more complex M queries for purposes of offline schema detection. For example, we are now able to correctly infer the table schema resulting from an M query that uses a custom function, such as the one in [this discussion](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/discussions/1413#discussioncomment-11532634).
- Fixed a bug which would cause a crash when selecting both a table and a column (in another table) in the TOM Explorer, and then invoking the right-click menu.
- Fixed an issue where clicking the "Back" button in the deployment wizard after selecting the Microsoft Entra MFA authentication option incorrectly triggered a login pop-up. The "Back" button now properly navigates to the previous step without attempting to authenticate.
