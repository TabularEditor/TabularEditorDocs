### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New in 3.7.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/?p=2146) to get an overview of the most important updates in this release.

- This release introduces the [Metadata Translations Editor](https://docs.tabulareditor.com/te3/features/metadata-translation-editor.html), which provides a fast an easy way to view, compare and edit all metadata translations applied across model objects.
- Tabular Editor 3 now supports the new [Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL)](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-public-preview-of-the-tabular-model-definition-language-tmdl/) as a format for saving/loading model metadata. You can enable TMDL (preview) serialization mode under **Preferences > Tools > Save-to-folder**.
  
> [!NOTE]
> TMDL is still in preview, and as such, this feature must also be considered a preview feature of Tabular Editor 3. Make sure to keep a Model.bim / Database.json backup of your model metadata to avoid losing work.**.

## Minor improvements in 3.7.0

- Now using latest version of [VertiPaq Analyzer](https://github.com/sql-bi/VertiPaq-Analyzer). This fixes an issue with collecting stats on models with Dynamic Format Strings, among other things.
- We now show a more meaningful error message, when a paste operation fails because of incompatible model metadata.
- Analysis Services trace events that are received after a data refresh job completes, are now correctly assigned to that job, enabling proper propagation of error/warning messages, as well as progress counts. See  [#735](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/735).
- The data preview window is now able to use the DAX [`OFFSET`](https://dax.guide/offset) function, which enables the preview to show all rows of non-DirectQuery tables, even when a model is in DirectQuery mode (such as when hybrid tables are present in the model), see [#500](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/500), [#837](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/837).
- When deplying a model as a new database, we now add a dummy partition to tables that use incremental refresh policy, when no partitions are present in the model metadata, to ensure the deployment succeeds.
- Data preview retains any filters applied, when a table is refreshed/processed. See [#780](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/780).
- When a table does not contain columns in a non-queryable state, the data preview now uses the table name directly in the generated DAX query, instead of wrapping it in a call to [`SELECTCOLUMNS`](https://dax.guide/selectcolumns). This should speed up the data preview on older versions of Analysis Services. See [#126](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/126).
- TE3 now uses the latest version of [Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client).
- Offline schema detection now supports using Shared (M) Expressions which define custom functions.

## Bugfixes in 3.7.0

- There was a problem in the newest version of AdomdClient used in 3.6.0, which causes a Pivot Grid to fail with an XML error message, when connected to the Power BI XMLA endpoint. We have downgraded AdomdClient to [19.55.3.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient.NetCore.retail.amd64/19.55.3.1), which solves this issue for now.
- Fixed an issue where local instances of Power BI Desktop were not shown in the "Local instances" dropdown.
- Fixed an issue where TE3 would not allow loading a model that did not have a database name specified.
- The "Please Wait" dialogs should no longer obstruct Azure AD sign-in windows.
- Stability improvements.
- Fixed an issue where the application would crash when attempting to copy/paste measures with dynamic format strings, see [#1099](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/issues/1099).
- DAX scripting of measures with format strings/dynamic format strings, now works as intended.
- Query-scoped columns are now handled correctly by the DAX semantic analyzer and auto-complete feature. See [#890](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/890).
- Open Model/File dialogs now correctly filters "database.json" files instead of showing all .json files in a folder.
- Fixed some visual issues with buttons on various prompt dialogs.
- Fixed an issue where the database selection is incorrect, when the list is filtered. See [#886](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/886).
- Fixed an issue where the "Save Model" action (Ctrl+Alt+S) was not enabled, even though the message bar indicated that the model had unsaved changes.
- Fixed an issue with "phantom" semantic errors in the DAX Editor, see [#792](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/792).
- Preview data should now respect the format string assigned to a column, see [#820](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/820).
- DAX query results should now show the time portion of DateTime values, when it is not 00:00:00.
