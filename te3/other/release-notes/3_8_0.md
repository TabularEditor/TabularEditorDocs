### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Improvements in 3.8.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/06/26/tabular-editor-3-june-2023-release/) to get an overview of the most important updates in this release.

- Tabular Editor 3 now lets you open [Power BI Desktop project (.pbip) files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-overview) or folders containing .pbip files. When such a folder contains multiple datasets, a list is shown, letting you select which one to open.
- The [June 2023 update of Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-june-2023-feature-summary/) now supports a much larger range of modelling operations that can be performed through external tools ("hardening"). In other words, when you connect Tabular Editor to Power BI Desktop (June 2023 or newer), you will now be able to add/edit calculated columns, calculated tables, relationships, hierarchies, and much more.
- We're now using the latest version of TOM/AMO ([19.65.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.NetCore.retail.amd64)).
  
> [!NOTE]
> TMDL and Power BI Desktop Projects (.pbip) is still in preview, and as such, these features must also be considered preview features of Tabular Editor 3. Make sure to keep a Model.bim / Database.json backup of your model metadata to avoid losing work.**.

## Bugfixes in 3.8.0

- Dependency view now has much better performance for models with large and complex dependency graphs.
- Some users have reported that editing certain properties, through the **Properties view**, caused the application to crash. This should no longer be the case.
- Semantic Analyzer should no longer report errors when a DAX query contains both query-scoped columns and query-scoped tables.
- Semantic Analyzer now correctly handles DAX expressions containing UTF-32 characters (emojis), although the DAX editor still has issues dealing with these. In general, we recommend avoiding the use of emojis in DAX expressions.
- Fixed a bug where repeatedly hitting Ctrl+Z (Undo) would clear the Expression Editor and even bring in unrelated expressions.
- Perspective Editor now correctly updates to reflect when new objects are added/removed to/from the model.
- VertiPaq Analyzer should no longer crash when a model contains Dynamic Format Strings.
- Fixed a regression with importing tables from Snowflake, which caused columns to have incorrect datatypes assigned.
- Fixed a regression with update schema/importing tables Snowflake, where the implicit data source properties had to be re-entered in the connection dialog.
- Fixed an issue where the toolbar buttons related to the Expression Editor would disappear, if the Expression Editor was docked as a tool window (i.e. not as a document window).
- DAX editors now perform a new semantic analysis, when changes that can impact DAX semantics are made to the model. This should ensure that the error messages shown in the DAX editor are always valid.
- Fixed an issue where the DAX debugger would be unavailable, even for seemingly simple DAX queries.
