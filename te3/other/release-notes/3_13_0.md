### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## New in 3.13.0

Check out our [release blog](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/12/15/tabular-editor-3-december-2023-release/) to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.

## Improvements in 3.13.0

- Unused variable warnings are now only shown when the variable declaration block is complete, and only the variable name itself is highlighted. Moreover, there is a new option where you can toggle off these warnings under **Tools > Preferences > DAX Editor > Code Assist**.
- VertiPaq Analyzer in TE3 now uses the same default settings as in DAX Studio. You can also configure the "Read statistics from DirectQuery tables" option now, under **Tools > Preferences > VertiPaq Analyzer**.
- We've made a small change to how the Refresh Policy on a table appears in the **Properties** view, to better align with [TOM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.table.refreshpolicy?view=analysisservices-dotnet). This change also lets you add annotations/extended properties to Refresh Policies, which previously wasn't possible. C# scripts can still use the Refresh Policy properties directly on the `Table` object, but we recommend updating scripts to access these properties through the `Table.RefreshPolicy` object instead.
- When selecting a table or column in the TOM Explorer, we now highlight (with **bold** font) any relationships the object is involved in, see [#865](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/865). This feature can be disabled under **Tools > Preferences > TOM Explorer**.
- We now display the main storage mode (Import, DirectQuery, DirectLake, etc.) of the model, in the title bar.
- In addition to tables, it is now possible to view relationships starting from a specific column in the "Dependencies" view. Right-click on a column and choose "Show dependencies", then choose the "Show relationships starting from this column" option, see [this comment](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/865#issuecomment-1490782086).
- We now show a warning in the **Messages** view when objects are in an unprocessed state. This applies to both tables, columns and partitions. It also solves [#1153](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1153).
- We now show a warning in the **Messages** view when a column uses a sort-by-column that has `IsAvailableInMDX` set to **false** (as this would otherwise produce an error when the model is saved/deployed). See [#868](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/868).
- We've updated AMO/TOM to use the latest version [19.72.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64/). This library also includes an updated version of TMDL, which should fix a deserialization issue, when a table has incremental refresh policy applied.
- When serializing a model using TMDL, we now also output a `database.tmdl` file, which contains metadata at the database level (name, compatibility mode, compatibility level, etc.), which should improve the overall TMDL experience.

> [!NOTE]
> **TMDL is still in preview and should not be used in production, as you may be impacted by breaking changes between updates.**
  If you encounter any issues opening a model that was saved as TMDL with an earlier version of Tabular Editor, a possible fix is to open the model from TMDL using the same earlier version of Tabular Editor, save it as a Model.bim file, and then use the latest version of Tabular Editor to open the Model.bim file and save it back to the TMDL format.

## Bugfixes in 3.13.0

- Fixed an issue where undo'ing (Ctrl+Z) the removal of a Refresh Policy from a table, would not restore the configuration of that Refresh Policy.
- Fixed an issue where the DAX editor auto-complete would suggest incorrect items for window function parameters, when the window function was used as a filter argument for [`CALCULATE`](https://dax.guide/calculate/) or [`CALCULATETABLE`](https://dax.guide/calculatetable/).
- Fixed a bug that prevented adding/removing levels to hierarchies, when connected to an instance of Power BI Desktop, even though this is a [supported modeling operation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools#data-modeling-operations).
- Fixed an issue where the "Calculate" refresh option did not appear for regular tables.
- Fixed an issue where evaluating only the current selection of a DAX Query would not work, if a line comment was directly above the first `EVALUATE` statement in the selection, see [#912](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/912).
- Tabular Editor should now let you "Open from folder", when the folder contains ".tmdl" files (previous versions of TMDL used the ".tmd" extension). See [#1175](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/1175).
- The logic for determining if a table is a "Date Table" was a bit too restrictive, which could cause false circular dependency errors in some cases, or incorrect display of overridden filter contexts in the DAX debugger (due to the implicit filter removal associated with date tables).
