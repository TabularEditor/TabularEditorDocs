The Messages view will tell you the Source and the object from which the message is being generated. 

There are two types of messages displayed Errors and Warnings
- Errors: This tab shows any errors that prevent your model from being deployed or saved. For example, if you have an invalid expression in a calculation item or a circular dependency in a relationship. 
- Warnings: This tab shows any warnings that does not concur with standards but does not prevent your model from being usable. This is for example having fully qualified measure references.
