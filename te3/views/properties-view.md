# Using the Properties grid in Tabular Editor 3

The Properties view in Tabular Editor 3 allows you to inspect and modify the properties of any object in your tabular model. 
You access the properties view by selecting an object in the TOM Explorer. You will then see a list of properties that are relevant for the selected object type, such as name, description, data type, format string, etc.
You can also access advanced properties that are not available in other tools like Visual Studio or Power BI Desktop.

The Properties view helps you to:

- View and modify the properties of any object in the model, such as tables, columns, measures, hierarchies, relationships, partitions, roles and perspectives.
- Filter and sort the properties by name or category using the search box and the buttons at the top of the view.
- Copy and paste property values between different objects using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V shortcuts.
- Undo and redo property changes using Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y shortcuts.
- You can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate and edit your properties. For example, you can press Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to move between different properties; press Enter or F2 to edit a property value; press Esc to cancel editing; press Ctrl+S to save changes;

> [!TIP]
> You can multi-select objects to see the properties they have in common and edit them in bulk. This can be useful for setting Format Strings, for example.


The Properties view is by default in the bottom right corner, but you can also open it by pressing F4 on your keyboard. You can also dock it to any side of the main window or undock it as a separate window.
