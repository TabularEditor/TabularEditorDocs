# C# Script Library: Beginner Scripts

These are more basic scripts that are easy to understand or modify. They have a defined scope and limited complexity; you don't need a reasonable knowledge of the C# language to use, understand and modify these scripts. They are thus a good place to start when beginning to author C# Scripts in Tabular Editor.
