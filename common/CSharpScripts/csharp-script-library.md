This section contains official Tabular Editor scripts that have been verified by the Tabular Editor team. However use of these scripts are still your own responsibility. These scripts are used in demos, conferences and documentation by the Tabular Editor team, and are maintained here for your convenience. 

There are also other resources online with C# Scripts that are maintained by the community such as PowerBI.tips excellent repository: [PowerBI.Tips C# Script Repository](https://github.com/PowerBI-tips/TabularEditor-Scripts)

## Tabuler Editor Versions

## Scripting with Tabular Editor as Power BI External Tool
<br></br>
> [!NOTE] 
> Some scripts does not work when connected to a Power BI Desktop model, due to the limitations of Power BI Desktop External tools: [External Tool Limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools#data-modeling-operations). You can still experiment with the script by enabling unsupported modeling operations under preferences.
