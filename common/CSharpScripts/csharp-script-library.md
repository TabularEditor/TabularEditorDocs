### Scripting with Tabular Editor as a Power BI External Tool
<br></br>
> [!NOTE] 
> Some scripts does not work when connected to a Power BI Desktop model, due to the limitations of Power BI Desktop External tools: [External Tool Limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools#data-modeling-operations). You can still experiment with the script by enabling unsupported modeling operations under preferences.
