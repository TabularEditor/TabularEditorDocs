# Direct Lake Semantic Models
Direct Lake semantic models connect directly to data sources stored in [Fabric One Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing a Direct Lake dataset through the XMLA endpoint will block your ability to change the Direct Lake dataset inside the Fabric Service. Only XMLA endpoint can then edit the Direct Lake This is one of the current limitations of this preview 
feature.

Tabular Editor 3 can create and connect to this type of dataset. For a tutorial on this please refer to our blog article: [Direct Lake semantic models: How to use them with Tabular Editor](https://blog.tabulareditor.com/2023/09/26/fabric-direct-lake-with-tabular-editor-part-2-creation/). 
Tabular Editor 3 can create direct lake semantic models with both the Lakehouse and Datawarehouse SQL Endpoint. 

Tabular Editor 2 can connect to Direct Lake semantic models, but does not have any built in functionality to create new tables or direct lake semantic models. This needs to be done manually or with a C# script. 

> [!NOTE]
> DirectLake models currently use a collation that is different from regular Power BI import semantic models. This may lead to different results when querying the model, or when referencing object names in DAX code.
 For more information please see this blog post by Kurt Buhler: [Case-sensitive models in Power BI: consequences & considerations](https://data-goblins.com/power-bi/case-specific)


<div class="NOTE">
  <h5>FABRIC IN PREVIEW</h5>
  Fabric is currently in preview and there are therefore several limitations to the changes that can be made to a Direct Lake dataset: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/directlake-overview#known-issues-and-limitations">Direct Lake Known Issues and Limitations</a>

## Identifying a Direct Lake model
The TOM Explorer informs what object type your tables are. A Direct Lake model's tables will have the object type 'Table (DirectLake)' to make clear that the open model is a Direct Lake model.
