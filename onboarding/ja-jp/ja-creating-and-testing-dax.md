# Adding measures and other calculated objects

Ever since Tabular Editor 2.x got released in early 2017, the ability to quickly modify DAX expressions across measures has always been the most popular feature of the tool. Combined with back and forward navigation, copy/paste operations, DAX dependency visualisation and undo/redo support, the tool has always been the preferred option for anyone working with large and complex data models, where the ability to quickly make multiple smaller changes is crucial.

The only complaint in this regard, by users of Tabular Editor 2.x, was the lack of DAX code assist features (sometimes called "IntelliSense"). Especially when you are not a 100% proficient with DAX (and very few people are!), having the DAX code editor assist you in remembering syntax, function parameters, etc. is incredibly helpful.

This has all been addressed with the new DAX code editor used by Tabular Editor 3.

The remainder of this article describes how to create measures and other calculated objects, and how to modify the DAX expressions on these objects. To learn more about the many features of the DAX code editor, see <xref:dax-editor>.

# Adding measures

Once you have [imported some tables](xref:importing-tables-data-modeling#importing-new-tables) to your model and [created relationships between them](xref:importing-tables-data-modeling#modifying-relationships-using-the-diagram), it is time to add some explicit measures containing your business logic.

> [!TIP]
> Technically, you are not required to add explicit measures to your model before visualizing data in a Power BI report. However, it is a best practice to always do so, as MDX-based client tools (such as Excel and Tabular Editor 3's Pivot Grid) requires explicit measures. In addition, [Calculation Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tabular-models/calculation-groups?view=asallproducts-allversions) only apply to explicit measures.

To add a new measure using Tabular Editor, right-click on the table in which you want to add the measure, then choose **Create > Measure** (ALT+1).

![Adding New Measure](~/images/adding-new-measure.png)

When a new measure is added, the name of that measure will be editable. Hit ENTER when you have provided a name for the measure. You can always edit the name later in the **Properties** view or by pressing F2 while the measure is selected in the **TOM Explorer**.

The **Expression Editor** view is used to provide the DAX expression for the measure. As you enter the code, notice how the DAX editor provides code suggestions and even underlines syntax or semantic errors.

![Add Measure Edit Dax](~/images/add-measure-edit-dax.png)

The dropdown box at the top left corner of the **Expression Editor** is used to switch between different DAX properties of the currently selected object. For example, in newer versions of Analysis Services, measures have an `Expression` property as well as a [`Detail Rows Expression`](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/controlling-drillthrough-in-excel-pivottables-connected-to-power-bi-or-analysis-services/). Other types of objects can have different properties that contain DAX code. For example, [KPIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tabular-models/kpis-ssas-tabular?view=asallproducts-allversions) have three different DAX properties. To add a KPI in Tabular Editor, right-click on a measure and choose **Create > KPI**.

If you want your measure to be hidden, simply right-click and choose the **Make invisible** (CTRL+I) option. Likewise, you can unhide a measure by choosing the **Make visible** (CTRL+U) option.

## Other measure properties

In addition to the `Name`, `Expression` and `Hidden` properties, you can use the **Properties** view to review and edit the value of all properties of the currently selected object(s) in the **TOM Explorer**. For measures, this is where you can set the `Format String`, for example. For more information, see [Properties view](xref:properties-view).

# Adding calculated columns

To add a calculated column, right-click on the table on which you want to add the column, and choose **Create > Calculated Column** (ALT+2). Give the column a name and edit its DAX expression using the **Expression Editor**, similar to how we did for measures above.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This option is not available by default when connected to a Power BI Desktop model. This is because of the [limitations of Power BI Desktop support for external tools](xref:desktop-limitations). Click the link to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> When the DAX expression of a calculated column has been changed, the table in which the column resides has to be refreshed before the column can be used in a report. See <xref:refresh-preview-query#refreshing-data> for more information.

# Adding calculated tables

To add a calculated table, right-click on the model or on the "Tables" folder, and choose **Create > Calculated Table** (ALT+6). Give the table a name and edit its DAX expression using the **Expression Editor**, similar to how we did for measures above. Notice that the columns on the table changes automatically, when you make a change to the DAX expression. This can cause cascading effects, if other DAX expressions reference the table, or if columns are used in a hierarchy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This option is not available by default when connected to a Power BI Desktop model. This is because of the [limitations of Power BI Desktop support for external tools](xref:desktop-limitations). Click the link to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> When the DAX expression of a calculated table has been changed, the table has to be refreshed before it can be used in a report. See <xref:refresh-preview-query#refreshing-data> for more information.

# Adding calculation groups

To add a [calculation group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tabular-models/calculation-groups?view=asallproducts-allversions), right-click on the model or on the "Tables" folder, and choose **Create > Calculation Group** (ALT+7). Give the Calculation Group a name. Also consider a different name for the default **Name** column.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This option is only available on models at compatibility level 1500 or higher.

To add calculation items, right-click on the newly created calculation group and choose **Create > Calculation Item**. Give the Calculation Item a name and edit its DAX expression using the **Expression Editor** similar to how we did for measures above.

You can arrange the display order of Calculation Items by dragging them around in the TOM Explorer, or by setting the `Ordinal` property within the **Properties** view.

> [!NOTE]
> When Calculation Items are added, renamed or removed from a Calculation Group, the Calculation Group has to be refreshed before it can be used in a report. See <xref:refresh-preview-query#refreshing-data> for more information.

# Common modeling operations

## Copy / paste

All objects in the TOM Explorer can be copied and pasted with Tabular Editor. You can even copy and paste between different instances of Tabular Editor, and even between Tabular Editor 2.x and Tabular Editor 3. You can use the familiar keyboard shortcuts:

- **Edit > Copy** (CTRL+C)
- **Edit > Cut** (CTRL+X)
- **Edit > Paste** (CTRL+V)

> [!TIP]
> If you want to replace one table with another, retaining all existing relationships to/from that table, copy a table to the clipboard, then select the table you wish to replace in the TOM Explorer and paste. You will be prompted whether you want to replace the selected table with the one in the clipboard.

## Undo / redo

Whenever a change is made to an object or property in Tabular Editor, the complete history of changes is tracked, allowing you to undo every change made. You can use the familiar keyboard shortcuts:

- **Edit > Undo** (CTRL+Z)
- **Edit > Redo** (CTRL+Y)

> [!NOTE]
> All text editors in Tabular Editor 3 have their own undo/redo history, so if the cursor is currently within a text editor, the keyboard shortcuts will undo/redo the typing within that editor. You can use the options in the **Edit** menu to perform an undo/redo at the model level, or deactivate the current text editor by clicking on another element in the user interface (such as the TOM Explorer).

# Navigation

While the cursor is over an object reference in the DAX editor, right-click and choose **Go to definition** (F12) to quickly jump to that object. Of course, you can also navigate between objects using the TOM Explorer.

You can use the arrow buttons in the top right corner of the **Expression Editor** to jump quickly back and forth between objects visited.

## DAX Dependencies

To view DAX dependencies between objects, select an object in the **TOM Explorer**, then right-click and choose **Show dependencies** (SHIFT+F12). This will open a window that displays the dependencies (in both directions) of the selected object. Double-click on an object in this window to quickly navigate to that object.

# Display folders

Once your model starts to gain a considerable number of measures, a good practice is to organize them using Display Folders. In Tabular Editor, to create a Display Folder, either edit the `Display Folder` property through the **Properties** view, or alternatively, right-click on the measure(s), and select the **Create > Display Folder** option.

You can also cut/copy/paste or drag and drop objects between display folders.
